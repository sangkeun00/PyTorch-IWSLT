you know , one of the great sensi@@ tivity in traveling , and one of the pleas@@ ures for eth@@ no@@ graphic research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , who still feel their past in the wind , to touch them on the rain sh@@ in@@ y st@@ ones , in the plants .
simply knowing that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ an@@ as are still traveling beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the importance of the my@@ ths of in@@ u@@ it is still very successful , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as , the budd@@ hi@@ sts are still tra@@ cking the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , which means the most un@@ fol@@ ding of the world , is to the most in@@ u@@ it , to the most in@@ u@@ it , to the most un@@ lo@@ gic of us , to the most re@@ vel@@ o@@ city of us , to the most re@@ vel@@ o@@ city , of the most un@@ ci@@ d@@ har@@ ma , of us , of the most un@@ ce of the most un@@ t@@ arian , of the most un@@ t@@ act of us , of the world , of us , of the most un@@ t@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ al life , of us , of being , of us , of being , of being , of the world , is still , of the most un@@ fol@@ ding of us , of the most un@@ fol@@ ding of us , of us , of us , of us , of us , of the most un@@ fol@@ ding of the world , of the most un@@ fol@@ ding of the world , of the world , is still , of us , of the world , of us , of us , of us , of the most of being in the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of us , of us , of the
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tation .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tu@@ als .
we have to deal with the un@@ stopp@@ ing separ@@ ation of death , and therefore it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dan@@ cing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique in@@ fle@@ ction of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the pen@@ an in the bor@@ ne@@ o for@@ ests , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the ca@@ is@@ u@@ t-@@ desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the middle of a car@@ a@@ wan@@ a desert .
all these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , different ways of ori@@ enting on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , when you think about it , can only ful@@ fill you with hope .
together , the coun@@ t@@ less cultures of the world form a web of spiri@@ tual and cultural life that surro@@ unds the earth and is as important to the wel@@ f@@ are of the earth as the biological life web you know as a bio@@ sphere .
you can think of this cultural lifest@@ yle web as an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and eth@@ no@@ sphere can be defined as the total amount of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , inspiration and intui@@ tions that have been defined by human imagination since the beginn@@ ings of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we can do as an amazing knowledge species .
and just like the bio@@ sphere has been highly re@@ je@@ cted , it happened at the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- just at a much higher rate .
no biolog@@ ist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are extin@@ ction shor@@ tly because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ ti@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ um in the field of biological diversity -- is almost not the same as optimi@@ stic diversity in the cultural world .
and the key indi@@ cat@@ or for that is the extin@@ ction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , 6@@ ,000 languages were spo@@ ken on earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r creatures .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means in which a particular culture can access to the material world &apos;s sou@@ l .
every language is like an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiri@@ tual possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , half of them are no longer wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer taught to young children . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than being wra@@ pped by sil@@ ence , one of the last people to speak your language , not to have a way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect hope ?
and yet , this horri@@ ble dest@@ in@@ y actually res@@ ist someone anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an el@@ der@@ ly man dies and takes the last sil@@ ver of an old language to the gra@@ ve .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be can@@ ton@@ es@@ ian .
let them be ko@@ g@@ i . &quot;
and then suddenly you would realize what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today i want to take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a short journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to make you understand what has actually been lost .
now there are some of us who sort of forget that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
take , for example , this kid of bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da believe that they have my@@ th@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally come up with the mil@@ ky flow of the east in the bel@@ ly of hol@@ y sna@@ kes .
this is a people who are not cognitive between the colors blue and green because the cele@@ sti@@ al scene is equal to the forest that people dep@@ end on .
they have a strange language and a hot rule called the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ o@@ gam@@ y : you have to mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks another language .
all of this is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar of these big houses that are spo@@ ken in because of the mis@@ che@@ es , six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who lear@@ ns language .
they just listen and then start talking .
or , one of the most intri@@ gu@@ ing tri@@ bes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ oran@@ i in the nor@@ the@@ ast of ecu@@ ad@@ or , an amazing people that was cont@@ ac@@ ted first in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries tried to connect and made a major mistake .
they thre@@ w sh@@ in@@ y pictures of themselves from the air , which we would consider as friend@@ ly gest@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people from the rain@@ forest in their life had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , found nothing and conclu@@ ded that this was business cards of the de@@ vil and killed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries with the spe@@ ar .
but the oran@@ i didn &apos;t just kill the spe@@ ar with the outside .
they went through each other .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths have happened through dri@@ ll@@ ing .
we tra@@ cked gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the people had become so old that because of their age , and we killed them with spe@@ ars .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps away and deter@@ mine which species of animals ow@@ ned .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i got a really ast@@ on@@ ishing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies that were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er and ton@@ ton cou@@ tes and being used to make it safe .
to make sense of that conversation , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in vo@@ dou@@ n and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a cul@@ t of black magic .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical view of the world .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the great world record , what would you say ?
christ@@ ent@@ um , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa there was no religious faith , and of course there was one and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the rema@@ ining of this very profound religious thought that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very time .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is this vi@@ vid relationship between the living and the dead .
the living be@@ ars are the spiri@@ ts .
the g@@ ho@@ sts can be char@@ ged by under the big water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of dance to re@@ place the sou@@ l of the living pre@@ vent@@ ing so that the ac@@ oly@@ th becomes the short moment for the god .
des@@ per@@ ate li@@ kes to say to the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists , &quot; you white goes to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re taking on the mind . how can you be har@@ med ?
look at these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in a tran@@ ce@@ -@@ state that con@@ tains glo@@ wing coal without burn , an amazing illu@@ stration of the spirit &apos;s ability to influence the body so that it hol@@ ds when it &apos;s re@@ placed in an extreme state .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met , the ko@@ g@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia was the most extraordinary .
neighb@@ or of the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal civilization , who popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an coast level of col@@ om@@ bia , and in a con@@ qu@@ ered con@@ qu@@ est , this people re@@ turned to an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massive , ris@@ ing up over the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an coast level .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed continent , these people were the only people who had never been con@@ qu@@ ered by the sp@@ ani@@ ans .
to this day , they &apos;re go@@ ver@@ ned by a ri@@ tual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , but the training of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths are now separ@@ ated from their families at the age of three and four , and in a sha@@ ky world of fin@@ ern@@ is , stone hat@@ s at the base of the gl@@ ac@@ ier for 18 years , spend two peri@@ ods of each nine years sho@@ ot@@ ing them to mi@@ mic the preg@@ nan@@ cy of their preg@@ nan@@ cy .
and throughout that time , they &apos;re cul@@ tur@@ ally introduced to the values of their society : values that main@@ tain cla@@ im that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we could say the ecolo@@ gical -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out , and for the first time in their life , at age 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to see the hands of the beautiful landscape , and in this cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment , it &apos;s been abstra@@ cted .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers and say we are the yo@@ unger brothers responsible for the destru@@ ction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think about the na@@ tive and landscape , we either words r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and old fra@@ me@@ work of no@@ ble wil@@ der@@ ness , which in its simpli@@ city is a ra@@ cial thought , or a th@@ ore@@ au and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , in@@ na@@ tive is not sen@@ ti@@ mental , or are you cho@@ sen by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for this in the malaria se@@ arch@@ ing sw@@ am@@ ps of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they still have , through time and ri@@ tual , a mysteri@@ ous kid@@ ney of the earth that is not gro@@ unded on the idea of being aware of being too close to human , but also being too far in a sub@@ tle idea .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child from the an@@ de@@ an who gro@@ ws up in belie@@ ving that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ -@@ spirit that will be or determin@@ es its dest@@ in@@ y will be a whole other person , and will have a different relationship with that resource or this place than a little child from mon@@ tan@@ a who can grow up in the pi@@ le .
whether it &apos;s a place of mind or a lot of her@@ it@@ age , it &apos;s ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the for@@ ests of british colum@@ bia and believed that these for@@ ests are there to be ra@@ ped .
this made me another person than my friends , under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l , who believe that these for@@ ests are at the nor@@ th@@ place of hu@@ ku@@ k and the cur@@ ved hi@@ g@@ mu@@ el and the kan@@ ni@@ bal@@ i spiri@@ ts that are at the nor@@ th@@ ern@@ ess of the world that they would live in .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
this is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca that many of you have heard of , the stron@@ gest psycho@@ active pra@@ yer from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ man .
what a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca does so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ colo@@ gical potential of this pre@@ par@@ ate , but its process@@ ing . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , but on one hand , there &apos;s this woo@@ den bi@@ ke li@@ an@@ e that &apos;s a series of color@@ ed mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to be har@@ sh in blue .
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins that are very similar to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tam@@ in 5 and metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ et@@ y@@ di@@ et@@ y@@ di@@ et@@ y@@ lic tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i s@@ ni@@ ff this stuff , this sub@@ stance that they make from different species also has metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ yl@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine .
so to s@@ ni@@ ff this po@@ w@@ der is something like being shot out of a gun , satur@@ ated by b@@ aro@@ que paint@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not gener@@ ated a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality .
i even have , with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes , the man who dis@@ mis@@ sed the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ an ap@@ re@@ a with the discovery of the magic mush@@ room in mexico in the 30@@ 0-@@ year years of talking about it . i &apos;m saying you couldn &apos;t have these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins as hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins is that they can &apos;t be taken hy@@ m@@ n , because they &apos;re used by a human gut , of course , they &apos;re oc@@ curr@@ ing enzy@@ me called mon@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase , den@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@ zed .
they can only be sam@@ pl@@ ed with some other chemicals , using the ma@@ o den@@ at@@ u@@ late .
now the amazing thing is that the be@@ ta@@ carb@@ ons that have in the li@@ an@@ e are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the way that you need to power the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ str@@ in@@ ous plants find these two mor@@ ph@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally un@@ related plants that , when combin@@ ed in this way , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version so the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , try and error , which turns out to be meaning@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , &quot; the plant spea@@ ks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca that you all recognize at a distance in the forest that appe@@ ars to our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them how they set up their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;d understand something about plants .
i mean , do you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you take each of the 17 vari@@ ants on the whole moon and you sing them in a different position .
now this doesn &apos;t give you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than coun@@ ting tri@@ ina .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sym@@ pathy for the difficult situation of the indi@@ gen@@ ous , think of them as or@@ g@@ ini@@ an and color@@ ful , but somehow con@@ fin@@ ed them to the past while the real world , meaning our world continu@@ es .
so , the fact is that in 300 years , you will remember the 20th century , not for your wars or technologi@@ cal innovation , but rather than an era where we were , and the massive destru@@ ction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active or passi@@ ve .
all cultures have always been involved in the dance of new living possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans didn &apos;t listen to si@@ ou@@ x any less than they were b@@ ent and ar@@ row tas@@ ks than the americans stopped being a horse and a horse car .
not change and technology thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . ug@@ ly face of rule .
and wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures are not re@@ f@@ used to the de@@ br@@ is of the trees , and these are dynam@@ ically living peop@@ les , whose existence is dis@@ placed by cognitive forces , that go beyond their capacity to ada@@ pt .
or when we go to ti@@ bet mountains , where i study a lot recently , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people is generally con@@ vi@@ cted , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destru@@ ction of the way people live , is not only con@@ vi@@ cted , but is cele@@ br@@ ated generally , as part of a developing strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of ti@@ bet@@ ans if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom .
i went to l@@ has@@ a with a young collea@@ gue 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in west china across sou@@ the@@ ast ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a , and only when i got to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents that were turned into sho@@ e and a@@ we@@ an a@@ f of the millions of people during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as a follo@@ wer of the pan@@ el lam@@ a .
that meant that during the chinese invasi@@ on , he was immediately killed .
his un@@ cle fle@@ w to the di@@ as@@ por@@ a with her hol@@ iness that brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was im@@ pris@@ oned , as a pun@@ ish@@ ment for -- to be weal@@ thy for cri@@ mes .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de under her rock pe@@ a@@ ks because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this bra@@ ve did was brought into an edu@@ ca@@ tional camp .
and one day she came out of miss to a arm@@ band of ma@@ os and for this meeting , she had to go to a heavy job camp for seven years .
suffering can be unbe@@ ar@@ able , but the dis@@ in@@ her@@ ent spirit of people is a little un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
and at the end of it , we really want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ies , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that , while we moved towards a thre@@ ad , sha@@ ped , gener@@ ous world@@ view , we will not only see the entire range of human imagination de@@ cre@@ ase in a min@@ d@@ ful way that one day we would ever see , but that we would have for@@ gotten from others .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species may have exi@@ sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment was sig@@ ning the cul@@ t of se@@ ed dna , the poetry of the sha@@ man through the pro@@ se of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and hierarch@@ y , speci@@ alization and sur@@ plus -- was only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is har@@ dly 300 years old .
now , this s@@ hal@@ low story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we face in the en@@ su@@ ing millen@@ nia .
if we ask these coun@@ t@@ less world cultures about the importance of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to re@@ discover what we are : people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance that all humans and gar@@ dens have to be able to be fac@@ ed with space , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in islands , walking with in@@ u@@ its to the nar@@ wh@@ al ja@@ g@@ d , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always gone very well with the in@@ u@@ it , and in the course of the 50@@ 0s in the establi@@ sh@@ ment of our regi@@ me , they &apos;ve been forced to move into sett@@ le@@ ments .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used .
the family that was afraid of his life took off all the g@@ uns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the in@@ u@@ it is not afraid of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the sli@@ des of their sli@@ ts were origin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in car@@ ib@@ be@@ an skin .
the grand@@ father of the man was not afraid of the arc@@ tic night or the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
he hat@@ ched out , dro@@ pped his pants down from sea do@@ g@@ gy fu@@ r and put them in his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started free@@ zing , he sha@@ ped them into the form of a kni@@ fe .
he spra@@ yed s@@ ali@@ va on the side of the fe@@ cal measu@@ re@@ ment and when it was completely fro@@ zen , he ama@@ zed a dog with it .
he contain@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a dis@@ h , took the skelet@@ on of dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , put on another dog and came across the ice cre@@ am with the fe@@ cal kni@@ fe at the bar@@ rier .
you can &apos;t do something like this .
and this , in many ways , is a symbol of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and all the in@@ fan@@ ts in the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave back the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l 199@@ 9 the full control over an area bigger than california and texas combin@@ ed .
it &apos;s our new country called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control miner@@ als .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can se@@ ek and reach back with his in@@ habit@@ ants .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed to these remote goals of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not at all away .
you &apos;re the countries of someone &apos;s home .
they represent part of the human imagination that goes back in recent times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geo@@ graphy of hope .
ultimately , what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we think politicians never do anything .
we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we believe po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs is not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we believe that story@@ telling can change the world , so we &apos;re probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world . our website gets 35 million h@@ its every month .
15@@ 6 nations send our television channel .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
and we &apos;re enter@@ ing a series of tri@@ ps to the eth@@ no@@ sphere in which we can take our audience to places like such cultural wonder@@ s that they &apos;re being built by the ab@@ und@@ ant world , and hopefully , one by one , they will assu@@ me the central epi@@ ph@@ any of anthropo@@ lo@@ gy : that it deser@@ ves to be a world that we have a lot of the world of the world of life in a different ways that we have .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we &apos;ve given microsoft as part of an ex@@ ception to just a year ago , which is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which they can either pass or re@@ move with vast amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here that you can get se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continue , turn , re@@ ar@@ range in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we see , how big these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the pictures are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the library of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ els .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can restri@@ ct the performance of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any moment . it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of non-@@ image data .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of text and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ mend it .
this is a reali@@ stic case . this is a copy from the guar@@ di@@ an .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real pa@@ per@@ work of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple sc@@ ales .
we &apos;ve also done something in the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong display with very high resol@@ ution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we ad@@ ded addi@@ tional content to it .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really reach@@ es up these ideas to map these limit@@ ations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense anymore -- this shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribu@@ te to this area as well .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
con@@ te@@ sted up in nasa &apos;s ur@@ gent view .
now let &apos;s get out something else .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th that really conne@@ cts two different technologies .
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is from no@@ ah sna@@ ke &apos;s , a university student in washington , under the coun@@ sel@@ ing of steve silk at u@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft research -- very good collabor@@ ation .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see that when we create these kinds of vie@@ ws where we can pen@@ et@@ rate through images and have this experience of multi@@ fold resol@@ ution .
but in fact , the spa@@ tial order of the images is important here .
the computer visi@@ on algorith@@ ms have stuck these pictures together so that they can con@@ form the real space where all of these images that have been made near the gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies . you can see there are elements of stabili@@ zed di@@ as or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging and all of these relationship .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environ@@ ments .
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch@@ line behind this technology , which is photo@@ syn@@ th technology , if you don &apos;t necessarily look at the website .
we had to worry about law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ame that occur@@ red only in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just add not@@ re d@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they are being found images of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and on the university site and so on when each one of the color@@ ed model was found .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r pictures , and they &apos;re all in spa@@ tial ways related to each other .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will end up working at microsoft .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ ception here .
i guess you can see that these are lots of different kinds of camer@@ as : everything is fli@@ pping from the mobile camera to professional sl@@ rs , a pretty large number of them all together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of them are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame , which was recorded proper@@ ly .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s now colle@@ cted data from all of them -- from the whole collective memory of what , visu@@ ally , the earth looks like -- and everything is being inter@@ connected .
all of these photographs are being connected , and something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
think of this as the sequ@@ el of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ers &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and this is something that is growing with the complexity that people use , growing , and its use for the user is getting bigger and bigger with appli@@ cation .
their own photos are ac@@ compli@@ shed with meta@@ data that another person has enter@@ ed .
if someone who &apos;s gone out and lab@@ el@@ ed all this sac@@ red and shared who you are , then my photo of the not@@ re dam@@ e ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly will be using all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point in order to di@@ ve into this other kind of experience , which i can use this kind of meta@@ verse .
and of course , by@@ product of all of these are the im@@ men@@ se virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that have been preser@@ ved not only by over@@ wing or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get it right ? does your software allow someone in the world to be used together at a certain time , in the next few years , all the images that are being used together by somebody in the world ?
yeah . she does nothing but discover .
if you want to make it hyper@@ links between the pictures .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of se@@ man@@ tic information that many of these images have .
like when you make a web search for pictures where you type sent@@ ences and the text of the website con@@ tains a lot of information about what picture that is .
but what if the image lin@@ ked them to all their pictures ?
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic cros@@ s-@@ quality is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . car@@ di@@ a@@ c con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that i hope are in harmon@@ y with other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections myself if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial belief of all western industri@@ alized societies .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our goal is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the public well-@@ being of our citizens , it &apos;s mostly through ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is because freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an essential predi@@ ction for human beings .
if people have freedom , then each one of us is about doing the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our public good and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it wouldn &apos;t come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply ro@@ ot@@ ed in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what en@@ ables modern progress .
this is my super@@ market . no big one .
i just want to say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
there &apos;s 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ i@@ co@@ essi@@ ons you could buy to make a big number of your sal@@ ad des@@ s@@ ings in which un@@ likely case none of the 17@@ 5 is right for you .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics business to put together a stere@@ o plant -- lou@@ d@@ speak@@ ers , c@@ d players , a cas@@ se@@ tte player , radio , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er . and there &apos;s so many stere@@ os in this one electr@@ on@@ ics business .
we can assem@@ ble 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o plants from the components that are off@@ ered in this one business .
you have to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every phone provi@@ der you wanted while it came from ma bell .
they r@@ ented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a con@@ sequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infin@@ ite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle -- mp@@ 3 play@@ er@@ - , nas@@ al ha@@ irs and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ é@@ e fac@@ tor@@ cles .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business yet , you can be sure that you &apos;re about to become it .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask that question .
do you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you said , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it patients autonom@@ y . it sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift in the bur@@ den of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- who &apos;s probably not white and most likely to be able to make a difference in the best const@@ it@@ ution .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs for people like you and me that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why are they adverti@@ sing around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in pres@@ cri@@ ption .
something as profound as our identity is now a matter of choice as to show this slide .
we don &apos;t ac@@ qui@@ re identity , we inv@@ ent it .
and we &apos;re as often rein@@ vent@@ ing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one , and they got as fast as they could , and then they got kids as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less car@@ efully car@@ efully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re bus@@ y with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i mar@@ ry now ?
should i mar@@ ry later ? should i have children , or should i have a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all in@@ conven@@ tional questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it means doing all the tas@@ ks i ad@@ mit to you and not getting a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed as car@@ l poin@@ ted out , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every place on the planet -- all the way to the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s actually a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about that the wir@@ el@@ ess@@ lan works on .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that we have this incredible freedom of choice about making decisions about work , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids play foot@@ ball , and we have our cell phones on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on others , and our laptop probably on our la@@ p .
and even though you &apos;re all turned off , every minute we look at our child mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ating a so@@ c@@ cer game , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be very different from your child &apos;s foot@@ ball game .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
i mean , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;ll know what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that instead of liber@@ ating paraly@@ sis .
with so many op@@ tions you can choose , people are very hard to even choose .
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ stic example of this , a study of invest@@ ments in volunte@@ er ages .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment recor@@ ds of van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic f@@ on@@ d@@ society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was every 10 investment fund that the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered took off by two percent .
they &apos;re off@@ ering 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees participa@@ te than if they were to offer only five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 invest@@ ments that are choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one should choose to sho@@ ot it at tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes tomorrow .
you know , not only does that mean that people have to eat dog food when they go into reti@@ re@@ ment because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss big invest@@ ments in their emplo@@ yers .
by not giving up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the emplo@@ yer who would be happy to re@@ produce their contribu@@ tion .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick the fal@@ se investment fund , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less satis@@ fied with the out@@ come of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is done by the great sele@@ ction of different sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision better . and what made this alternative , eu@@ ver@@ ically , and what made you .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is not to regre@@ t anything that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting to the choices you make .
secon@@ dly , what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ ity cost .
dan gil@@ bert did a big point this morning by telling how much we &apos;re gra@@ ding things depends on what we &apos;re compar@@ ing .
well , if there are lots of alterna@@ tives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attra@@ ctive properties of alterna@@ tives that they ex@@ clu@@ de that makes them less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives they cho@@ se .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s some on the ham@@ pt@@ ons .
very expensive real e@@ state .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends two weeks from the thought that he &apos;s tra@@ cked the possibility , day after day , to have a great par@@ king lot .
op@@ per@@ tun@@ ity costs down the satis@@ fac@@ tion that we get from our choice , even when what we looked for is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to choice , the more attra@@ ctive properties of this choice are taken into the oper@@ a cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this carto@@ on makes some stat@@ ements .
he makes a point about living in now and maybe doing things slowly .
but one of the important things he does is , who do you choose to decide not to do other things ?
and these other things may have many attra@@ ctive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less attra@@ ctive .
third , es@@ cal@@ ation of expe@@ c@@ tations .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only je@@ ans one way , and they bought them , and they mis@@ sed b@@ ad@@ ly , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if they had long enough to wear them and often was@@ h enough , they started feeling ok .
so to buy new je@@ ans after many years of the old je@@ ans , and i said , &quot; i want a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want sna@@ ke , easy or long ?
do you want to was@@ h butt@@ ons or fri@@ ction ? stone or ac@@ id ?
do you want to protect je@@ ans with holes ?
do you want to cut far cut , ke@@ en , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on he said .
my ja@@ w was down , and after i reco@@ vered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that used to be the only species . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying all of these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i left the store -- and i say the truth -- with the best pas@@ sen@@ gers of je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse with all these available possibilities , my expe@@ c@@ tations for what was going on for a good couple of je@@ ans .
i had very low expe@@ c@@ tations . i didn &apos;t have con@@ cre@@ te expe@@ c@@ tations when there was only one way .
when they came to 100 species , dam@@ n it , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had gotten to what i expected , and what i had been dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting compared to what i expected .
ad@@ ding opportunities to people &apos;s lives ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably incre@@ ases people &apos;s expe@@ c@@ tations about how well these possibilities will be .
and this leads to less satis@@ fac@@ tion , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you were to , you wouldn &apos;t know what this is about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything that was worse than anything worse was , it was possible for the people to experience that was a pleas@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days in the world we live in -- we &apos;re weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , perfe@@ cted as an expe@@ c@@ tation -- the best for which you can ever hope is things as good as you expect them .
they &apos;re never going to be surprised because their expe@@ c@@ tations , my expe@@ c@@ tations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all came to -- the secret to happiness is low expe@@ c@@ tations .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal moment -- which i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
but to de@@ fe@@ at is not always such a bad thing .
finally , a con@@ sequence of buying a bad se@@ ating je@@ ans if there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if they &apos;re dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you wonder why who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could they have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and they ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it &apos;s so clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the window , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the out@@ comes are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about it , they acc@@ use themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the developed world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression and su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have learned that dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it &apos;s their fau@@ lt .
and so the ima@@ ging result is that we are generally better , obje@@ ctive , and we feel worse .
so let me re@@ mind you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s a little bit better than no choice , but there &apos;s no more choice than there is .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve been missing that do@@ t for a long time in which we &apos;ve impro@@ ved our public good .
now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a key question to think about it . what all this choice en@@ ables in the industri@@ alized societies is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard many of them whose problem is not too big .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and so an@@ gry : steve le@@ vi@@ tt told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard to inst@@ all car se@@ ats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hur@@ t .
they make it worse for us standing there .
if something of what en@@ ables people of our society to make so decisions about the societies in which people have moved too little choice , not only would people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but would also improve our dig@@ ni@@ ty .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ et@@ o impro@@ vement appli@@ cation .
income distribution is going to make sure everyone &apos;s better -- not just the poor -- because all this big sele@@ ction is pla@@ gu@@ ing us .
finally , please read this carto@@ on , and a sophistic@@ ated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this gold@@ fish glass . &quot;
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a shor@@ t-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you break up the gold@@ fish glass so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
if you break the gold@@ fish glass , so that everything is possible , you lower happiness .
they increase paraly@@ sis , and they lower happiness .
everybody needs a gold@@ fish glass .
this is almost limited to complete security -- possibly also for fish , definitely for us .
but the ab@@ han@@ den being of a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and i sus@@ pe@@ ct , cat@@ astrop@@ he .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biolo@@ gists have tried to understand and understand that at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to simpli@@ fy different approach@@ es to the mini@@ mal components .
we di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed almost 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , the shift from the analo@@ g world of biology to the digital world of computers .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can re@@ generate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tali@@ um , which has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to dis@@ pen@@ se to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this met@@ abo@@ lic map , which is very simple compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all these genes that we elimin@@ ate one by one , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to one living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward is to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , which allows us to v@@ ary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
is it possible for chemistry to make these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ her@@ ited chemical material .
our steps in di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life were exponenti@@ al .
our ability to write genetic code has been evol@@ ving very slowly but still increas@@ ed , and our final point would now be on an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years to start with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
it turns out dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna long , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes you make .
so we had to develop a new way of putting together these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error corre@@ ction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ formed chemical and put it into a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells and came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said they were really fo@@ ol@@ ing this model .
they laugh@@ ed more than they did here .
so we think this is a situation where software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it had over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cas@@ se@@ tte tape the size of the virus that we could v@@ ary the size of a cas@@ se@@ tte to understand what the living cell was .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information on the computer , you have to really be wrong with this digital information .
when we first sequen@@ ced the genome in 199@@ 5 , the error rate of a mistake per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we found 30 mistakes in res@@ cu@@ e . if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
one part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long and that need to over@@ la@@ p with other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub-@@ fac@@ ets so that they fit together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded water@@ mar@@ ks .
think about it : we have a four@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t@@ .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters en@@ code about 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids , and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phr@@ ases , thoughts .
we sig@@ ned only at first .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it was not poetry .
we engine@@ ered the pieces so that we could just break them up with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and re@@ pair them .
and we started creating pieces , starting with pieces that con@@ tain five to se@@ vent@@ h letters , put them together to make 24@@ ,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces to put them back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we made these pieces over@@ -@@ shot so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so , it looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball bil@@ l@@ board .
when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e@@ .@@ col@@ i . it ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds all the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew about a mechan@@ ism of hom@@ olog@@ ist re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put those pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that survi@@ ves three million ra@@ ds of radiation .
you see in the upp@@ er field that his chromo@@ some just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything was re@@ united again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dry , they can even live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life can exist in space and move , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of this out there .
here &apos;s a dre@@ ad of the molecule that we made using these processes -- in fact , we just used he@@ ck mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces , we ad@@ ju@@ sted them . ye@@ ast ad@@ ds them up auto@@ matically .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ scope that &apos;s a regular micro@@ scope .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light micro@@ scope .
this is foot@@ age over six seconds th@@ um@@ b .
this is the publi@@ cation we just finished recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a si@@ zes of 10 and no di@@ stances , it would be equivalent to 14@@ 2 pages just to print out this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s as much easier to do in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ts as we are : you just take out the nu@@ cle@@ us and put another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about c@@ lon@@ ing .
arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria are integr@@ ating the chromo@@ some into the cell , but just recently we &apos;ve shown that you can take a whole transp@@ l@@ ant from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we cle@@ an@@ ed the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bi@@ al species . in fact , these two are as far apart from each other as humans and mi@@ ce . and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromo@@ some . we de@@ plo@@ yed it with enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all the proteins , and it was very amazing -- and we put it into a cell -- and we put it in an amazing thing .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here , but we tried to bring the process a little bit further .
that &apos;s the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromo@@ some or a third of any place to add thousands of characteri@@ stics in just one second to one species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to change at some point a lot from biology .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that are actually going to di@@ gest dna .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell has no one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es we put in .
it was ex@@ clu@@ ded in the cell and recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as a foreign material , so we just ended up having one cell with a new chromo@@ some .
it pain@@ ted blue because of the genes that we ad@@ ded .
and after a very short time , there had lost all the characteri@@ stics of species and conver@@ ted completely into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
all the proteins changed the me@@ m@@ bran@@ es -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red .
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ im@@ ie , but we can change software dna by changing things quite dra@@ matically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that this is not gen@@ es@@ is -- this is based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
and i argu@@ ed that we may be creating a new form of cam@@ brian explosion in which there may be massive new arti@@ facts based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;ve grown from six and a half billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today three people on this planet are there for every one that has exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billion bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
when we think about biological processes or any process to re@@ place that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies all over the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry had a do@@ zen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re actually hit@@ ting the limit@@ s of biological reality and this idea .
we have technologies today because of these fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing metho@@ ds to do what we call combin@@ at@@ or@@ ical gene@@ tics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or optimi@@ zing these processes to produce o@@ ct@@ an , or drugs , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology with a single team than we &apos;ve been doing over the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only only sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct for life , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a photograph of actual design software that we &apos;re working on , where you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what its genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now foc@@ using on the fourth generation fuel .
you saw cor@@ n too eth@@ an@@ ol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have second and third generation fuel coming out pretty soon that will have much higher sugar levels , like o@@ ct@@ an or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a huge impact without increasing the cost of food or the limit@@ ation of its avail@@ ability is when we see co2 as a source material , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of fu@@ els in the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organis@@ m that we described in 199@@ 6 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , in almost cooking water temper@@ atures .
it trans@@ forms co2 into me@@ than@@ e using hydro@@ gen as an energy source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use stor@@ ed carbon , which could just be brought to production plans , conver@@ t co2 into fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ate goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the whole pet@@ ro@@ chemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? become a main source of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on using the same approach@@ es for developing vac@@ cin@@ es .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always on the back of it , and we have less of a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by making re@@ combin@@ ed vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes today , the evolutionary tree can be acceler@@ ated with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ es , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ tes .
we are light years away from making people better . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed to come back and tell you how this machine works .
so here it is . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever approach@@ ed -- 27 kilometers in diam@@ eter .
his job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ ti@@ ous .
this is the machine underneath gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take pictures of this mini@@ -@@ big bang in dete@@ ctors .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on . it &apos;s called at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters in the wid@@ th , 22 meters in diam@@ eter .
here &apos;s a spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ular picture of the at@@ las in construction so you can see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine went on for the first time .
and this is an image taken by at@@ las .
it caused im@@ men@@ se ju@@ bel in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation partic@@ le that took all the way back around the l@@ h@@ c , then collap@@ sed with a part of the l@@ h@@ c to make a rain of particles colli@@ de on the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew the machine worked , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest le@@ ver , or this , when someone vis@@ ited the google side and found the starting page like this .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific achie@@ vement .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wir@@ es here -- these gol@@ den wir@@ es here .
these wir@@ es condu@@ ct 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ ples when the machine is running at high-@@ performance .
now , the engineers am@@ on@@ gst them will look at you and say , &quot; no , you &apos;re not . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
they can afford it because if you cool it down very far , they become so@@ -@@ called super@@ condu@@ ctors .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the room between the stars , these wir@@ es can main@@ tain ten@@ sion .
in one of the connections , between 9@@ 0,000 magne@@ ts at the l@@ h@@ c , there was a man@@ ual tur@@ re@@ t .
so all of a sudden the wir@@ es heat up and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ ters en@@ counter@@ ed electric resi@@ stance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is even more amazing when you imagine that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons and shif@@ ted by about 30 in@@ ches .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
and they had to re@@ move what we did .
we re@@ designed them , we re@@ pa@@ i@@ red them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will work again .
we &apos;re going to turn on it and expect to be able to collect first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue to use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in some ways , such acci@@ dents again re@@ mind the debate to re@@ je@@ ct the value of science and engineering on those bor@@ ders . it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct that kind of thing .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our boun@@ dar@@ ies is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i think , when he de@@ f@@ ends the us@@ eless experiments of his teaching , his app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce was michael far@@ a@@ day , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human spirit that it &apos;s not going to take on in science .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my prof@@ ession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , life@@ -@@ long love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect it to ever change .
however , recently something weird happened in my life and my career that made me re@@ think my relationship to this work completely .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a bio@@ graphy called the ba@@ g , pra@@ y , love ba@@ g -- that , unlike all my previ@@ ous books went out into the world for some reason and became a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international best s@@ eller thing .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m being treated as if i were re@@ f@@ used to the de@@ mis@@ e .
seriously -- the process is re@@ f@@ using !
for example , do you care about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear you will never over@@ come that success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to continue your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ? never again ?
okay , it &apos;s really coura@@ ge@@ ous .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told as a teenager that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of an@@ xi@@ ety response .
people said , &quot; well , don &apos;t you be afraid to never succe@@ ed ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that the hu@@ mili@@ ation of a stat@@ ement kill@@ s you ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to follow your life and never come out of it and you &apos;re going to die on a bo@@ ot@@ ed dreams -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter as@@ hes of failure ?
like this , you know .
and the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; present . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always did .
and i &apos;m afraid of many more things that no one would ever know .
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ ghten@@ ing things .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i wonder , why ?
is that reas@@ on@@ able ?
is it lo@@ gical that somebody should be expected to be afraid of doing the work they &apos;re working on ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enter@@ pris@@ es is that they make us un@@ certain about the state of mind -- in a way that other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was a chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist where he was asked if he was afraid to be a chem@@ ist .
with your chemical block@@ ade , john -- how do you deal with it ?
it just didn &apos;t occu@@ r , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts over the cent@@ u@@ ries didn &apos;t get the reputation of al@@ co@@ hol depres@@ sed people .
we seem to have that kind of call , but not just the wri@@ ters , but the creative of all the gene , seem to have that reputation , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
all you have to do is look at the bit@@ ter death numbers of really great minds alone from the 20th century , young and often died of your own hand .
and even those who are not actually commit@@ ting su@@ i@@ ci@@ d seemed to be really ne@@ gle@@ cted by their tal@@ ents .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er said just before he died in his last interview : each of my books killed me a little bit more .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement they can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even listen to someone like this , because we &apos;ve known these kinds of stat@@ ements for so long . somehow we &apos;ve ac@@ cep@@ ted the notion so intern@@ al and colle@@ ctively that creativity and suffering somehow bel@@ ong together and that art -- always leads to se@@ a@@ qu@@ al .
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone here today is , is this idea completely fine for you ?
do you feel comfortable with that ? because if you look at just one centi@@ meter apart , i don &apos;t feel comfortable with this notion at all .
i find them dis@@ gu@@ sting .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them take over to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re living our big creative m@@ ess .
and i definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous to begin to sort of s@@ wal@@ low this dark path of pres@@ um@@ ption -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that all i &apos;m being as@@ sig@@ ned by the world as the work that came after my last book &apos;s success , right ?
i &apos;ll just say it , because we &apos;re all friends here in some way -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that someone can get to start at 9 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , drink g@@ in . and i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d like to continue doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of refle@@ cting , i seem to have to continue to write , design a kind of prote@@ ctive psycholo@@ gical design .
somehow , from now on , i have to find a way to keep a safe distance between myself and my very natural sti@@ r about how the reaction to the writing will be .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models over the past year to do this , i &apos;ve also se@@ arch@@ ed in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sensi@@ ble ideas about how to deal with creative creativity .
this qu@@ est led me to the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me .
please follow me because the circle will close again .
but in ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ v@@ ine di@@ vin@@ ity mind that comes from a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source to people -- for un@@ expla@@ ined , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ v@@ ine den@@ ener@@ y minds of creativity in den@@ ial .
it &apos;s been known by so@@ cr@@ ates that he believed he had a demon@@ stration that would give him gra@@ ve@@ ways from far away .
the ro@@ man had the same idea , called this kind of bo@@ di@@ ly creative mind a little bit of a kind of touch .
that &apos;s great . the ro@@ man didn &apos;t really think a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine cre@@ ature that was believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio -- sort of like do@@ bby , the hou@@ se@@ work -- the come out and the artist at work would sort of be invisible .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i &apos;m talking about -- the psycholo@@ gical constru@@ ct that prote@@ cts you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the age was prote@@ cted from certain things , like , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t cover everything for you , everybody knew you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us that helped you .
if your work fle@@ w -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a little laugh@@ ing .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came along and changed everything . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the go@@ ds and my@@ stery , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ st@@ ical creatures embra@@ cing di@@ v@@ ine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to think that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this or this artist a geni@@ us -- instead of having a geni@@ us .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think allo@@ wing a m@@ ere person to think that he or she &apos;s like the bas@@ in and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , infin@@ ite my@@ stery is a little too much responsibility to set up a human citi@@ zen .
it &apos;s like asking someone to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it dis@@ plays and dis@@ integr@@ ates whole e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ reached expe@@ c@@ tations of success .
i think this success pressure has killed our artists over the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- that &apos;s the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps re@@ turning to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the my@@ stery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t er@@ ase the thought good from 500 years of rational human@@ ism just in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would report really , truly , truly , scientific dou@@ bt about the idea of -- basically , fe@@ e@@ ds that people follow and apply fe@@ e@@ bility to their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on that journey .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
why not think that ?
because it makes just as much sense as any other thing i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to expla@@ ining the absolutely in@@ san@@ e cap@@ ability of the creative process .
a process that -- as anyone who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- in other words , everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always pre@@ tend sensi@@ ble .
in fact , sometimes it can feel just par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
i had such an en@@ counter recently when i met the extraordinary american po@@ et in ru@@ th stone , who is now over 90 , but her whole life was po@@ et , and she told me that when she was growing up in the vil@@ la@@ tive virg@@ ini@@ a , she could now work on the fields and she could feel like she could .
she said it would be like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
it would roll over the country .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew that she could do only one thing in such a moment , and that was -- in her words , like the de@@ vil .
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house as she was tra@@ cked by this po@@ em , and it was only about getting her fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen so she could capture it if she could go through her and grab on the she@@ et .
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and she roll@@ ed the po@@ em through her , and she mis@@ sed it . she said it was going to continue to move across country and -- like she said , &quot; better for another po@@ et .
and then there were those moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost miss it .
so she runs to the house , and she sear@@ ches for paper , and the po@@ em goes through her , and she reach@@ es a pen just as it goes through her , and then she said -- it was like reach@@ ing with her other hand and getting it pac@@ ked .
she caught the po@@ em on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the she@@ et of paper .
in these opportunities , po@@ em came in fre@@ ely and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but back@@ wards -- from the last word to the first .
and when i heard that , i thought that was im@@ men@@ se -- that &apos;s exactly the way my creative process happens .
it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a mul@@ ber@@ ry . to work , i have to stand up and swim every day at the same time , pe@@ el through and really aw@@ k@@ ward .
but i &apos;ve sometimes cra@@ mm@@ ed this thing in my mou@@ ths .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came through from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we relate to that without losing our minds , but keeping ourselves on the contr@@ ary of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its . i got to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ tured modern artist who was trying to domin@@ ate these un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that lived inside him and deal with them .
but then he got older and qui@@ et@@ er . he told me that one day he was driving on a ra@@ pid street in los angeles , and it all changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly heard a small frag@@ ment of a tun@@ e that , as it is often in@@ spe@@ cted , is difficult for him . and he wants them . it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous . he &apos;s le@@ ak@@ ed after that , but he can &apos;t touch them .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a cas@@ se@@ tte recor@@ der .
so he starts to cli@@ mb up this old thing , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tra@@ cked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i &apos;m not able to do it .
but instead of getting into pan@@ ic , he just stopped .
he finished the whole process of thinking and did something completely new .
he just looked up at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot;
how could i write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a che@@ aper moment when i can take care of you .
if not , squ@@ ee@@ ze somebody else today .
go and squ@@ aw@@ k le@@ on@@ ard co@@ hen .
his whole process of labor has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy cl@@ um@@ p surro@@ unding it was li@@ f@@ ted when he took out the geni@@ us where he was not making anything more anno@@ ying and left him where he came from . he realized it didn &apos;t have to be a tor@@ mented , ag@@ oni@@ zing thing .
there could be a real , wonderful , bizar@@ re collabor@@ ation , a kind of conversation between tom and stran@@ gers , ou@@ trage@@ ous thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also slightly changed the way i worked and it saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of eating , pra@@ y , love po@@ ols . i fell into one of these ri@@ bs that we all fall into when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s written a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just come up with this project .
but then i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed how tom had spo@@ ken in the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view of the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i talked my com@@ ment towards a blan@@ k corner of space .
i said , &quot; listen , you know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fau@@ lt , right ? &quot;
because you see i &apos;m invest@@ ing in everything i have . i don &apos;t have that anymore .
so if you want to do better , here you have to cross and main@@ tain your share of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m still going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i would like to say to proto@@ co@@ l that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it is like follo@@ ws . cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the deser@@ ti@@ est north africa , people gather@@ ed to mon@@ th@@ ly dan@@ ces and music that had been held for hours -- until da@@ wn .
they were always great because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but occasi@@ on@@ ally , something very rare happened , and one of the per@@ form@@ ers actually became over@@ se@@ cular .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know all of you in your life have seen such a performance .
it was like the time was sil@@ ent and the dan@@ cer walk through a kind of p@@ lot . he did nothing but he ever did -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before . but everything was coming together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appe@@ ared completely human .
it was li@@ t up from the inside and li@@ t up from the bottom , and everything ill@@ umin@@ ated through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
when this happened , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together , and they started sing@@ ing : po@@ ol , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . po@@ o .
this is god , you know ?
interesting histor@@ ical note : when the mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es con@@ qu@@ ered south spa@@ in , they brought this practice along . the language changed , over the course of cent@@ u@@ ries of poly@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , sil@@ ly one-@@ on-@@ one , ol@@ é , ol@@ é bot@@ t@@ len@@ es@@ hi@@ p and you &apos;re still hearing about how to fight .
if a per@@ tur@@ er in spa@@ in did something impossible , something ma@@ gical , which is that it &apos;s used to be sha@@ dy , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo fel@@ lo@@ w@@ able , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning when the dan@@ cer wake up himself and recogni@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock on a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he no longer car@@ ries a fif@@ th of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with pain@@ ful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;ll never rise to those hei@@ ghts .
and maybe somebody will never call god &apos;s name again when he turns . but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful corre@@ ctions of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so embar@@ ras@@ sed if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence came from you .
if you think you &apos;re just a ligh@@ t@@ weight -- from an un@@ belie@@ vable source for a read@@ able time of your life passed on to somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think for the last few months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s about to appear -- as the dangerous , sc@@ ary , well-@@ expected after@@ wards of my des@@ cen@@ ded success@@ es .
what i have to say to myself all the time is , when i get crazy about it , i &apos;m not afraid .
don &apos;t be dis@@ coura@@ ged .
just do your job .
be there for your contribu@@ tion , whatever it wants to be .
if your job is dan@@ cing , dance .
if the du@@ mb di@@ v@@ ine geni@@ us that &apos;s set asi@@ de for a moment deci@@ des to show a thro@@ at of mira@@ cles through your eff@@ or@@ ts , it &apos;s sil@@ ly !
and if not , still dance .
and fel@@ ol@@ é ! for you despite all this .
i believe in it and i feel like we should teach it .
fel@@ ol@@ é ! for you despite all this , just for you to have the na@@ ked human love and self-@@ meaning to be there .

thank you .
ol@@ é !
last year i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s that had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k for three million years the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t really express the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of ice .
in a sense , arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s are the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system .
it gro@@ ws in winter and it s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se picture of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the perman@@ ent ice is lab@@ el@@ ed with red .
as you can see , it gro@@ ws on the dark blue . this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter ; and it s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks in summer .
the so@@ -@@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood flo@@ wing out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will have disappe@@ ared from here to here .
this is a problem because warming is looking at the bottom of the arc@@ tic ocean where there are large amounts of fro@@ zen carbon , which when it &apos;s looked up , it &apos;s trans@@ posed from micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .
compared to the entire amount of climate change materials in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we cros@@ sed that critical point .
already today , in some flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e itself from water .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at al@@ as@@ ka has travel@@ ed to another group of labor to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how are we going to get here ?
and one reason is that this enormous heat war@@ mer war@@ ms green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al swa@@ p of water .
but volu@@ me is much bigger than ever before .
this is kan@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know how sea level is flo@@ wing through land ice she@@ ets here , it flo@@ ws into the sea .
these ri@@ vers are taking ra@@ pid ri@@ vers .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
researchers sig@@ ned up last month that the entire continent now has a negative ice foot@@ print .
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which has emer@@ ged over a few under@@ water islands , is particularly strong in mel@@ ting .
this is like 20 feet of sea level , like green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as , the third largest ice mass , you see new la@@ kes up there that were gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting water .
in the an@@ de@@ an , this gl@@ ac@@ ier is the drin@@ king water source for this city .
the water levels have exp@@ and@@ ed .
but when you se@@ al , most of the drin@@ king water will fall away .
there was a 40 percent redu@@ ction in s@@ now in california in si@@ er@@ ra .
this is the sin@@ k .
and the predi@@ ctions you &apos;ve read are serious .
this au@@ stro@@ ck@@ age throughout the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase in fire .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers all over the world have been in a really extraordinary and previ@@ ously un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented ex@@ tent .
four times as many over the last 30 years as in the previ@@ ous 7@@ 5@@ 0s .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable development pattern .
if you look at this in histor@@ ical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day into the oceans .
look closely at the real@@ m of eastern pacific , from the american continent western and beyond the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dra@@ stic dec@@ line in oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most comfortable problem .
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ tan@@ ts together with china .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al was to build many more coal fac@@ tor@@ ies .
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
here are the ones that have been stri@@ ped over the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed .
mean@@ while , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the coal industry and oil industry spent a quar@@ ter billion dollars last year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself .
this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
christ@@ mas was walking around at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , one billion tons of coal lam@@ b .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news appar@@ ently .
this is all over our country of the second largest waste in america .
this happened around christ@@ mas .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of the coal industry for christ@@ mas was this .
fro@@ sty the carbon man is a de@@ light , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and ab@@ und@@ ance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy grow .
fro@@ sty , the carbon man gets cle@@ aner every day .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and worth lo@@ ving , and workers re@@ main in lo@@ ans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
let me say one very clear thing . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry ri@@ ding , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has started two campaig@@ ns .
this is one , part of it .
in co@@ al@@ er@@ gy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
so we set it down to the top line to spend a substan@@ tial amount of money on trying to get an adverti@@ sing on the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dir@@ ty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it sm@@ ells even good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s quiet that .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , changing the remarkable coal technology that you see here .
look car@@ efully , this is today &apos;s clean , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative is mix@@ ing with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts them all together is our depen@@ dence on carbon based fu@@ els such as dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a b@@ old new solution to free ourselves from that mis@@ ery .
if america is 100 percent cle@@ aner electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us sa@@ fer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
u@@ tili@@ ty america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a re@@ lief from america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways of redu@@ cing our depen@@ dence on old , dir@@ ty fu@@ els that make our world work .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new invest@@ ments to create well-@@ paid jobs .
u@@ tili@@ ty america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start asking you to think back to the time you were childhood when you were playing with building blocks .
while they realized how to reach out and grab your hands , pick up the jo@@ kes and move them , they actually learned to think and solve problems through understanding and change spa@@ tial connections .
spa@@ tial thinking is deeply ti@@ ed to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction we did with real objects -- along with my exper@@ ti@@ se pat@@ ti and my collea@@ gue , je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started wonder@@ ing : what if we wanted to use computers , instead of a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , which would be like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p ?
this question was so profound that we decided to explore the answer and si@@ ft@@ able .
in short , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
you can be moved by your hand , you can percei@@ ve each other , you can pick up your movements , and you have a screen and a fe@@ ature .
more importantly , it &apos;s physical , which is why you can only move it out of your hands and your access .
and the si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital data .
and if these tools become more physical and an awar@@ eness of their movements , recognize each other and percei@@ ve the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of our surro@@ und@@ ings with them , then we can start to explore new and entertain@@ ment types .
i &apos;ll start with a couple of simple examples .
this si@@ ck@@ able is designed for video re@@ con@@ fig@@ ur@@ able , and if i pe@@ b@@ ble it in one direction , the video will be played forward , if i pe@@ b@@ ble it the other way , it &apos;s going back@@ wards .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its come true to each other .
so when i put them si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , that gets their interest .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded by one , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and their tenden@@ cy .
and an interesting con@@ sequence of the inter@@ actions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures to data , like prote@@ cting colors the way you do it with flu@@ ids .
in this case , we &apos;ve created three si@@ del@@ ables as a color po@@ t , and i can use them to po@@ ur color in the middle , where they &apos;re then mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ do it , we can shake back a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or lo@@ gic games , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and we want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series that i do with a simple equ@@ ation program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
basically , you get every round on every si@@ gh@@ ted letter at random , and as you try to form words , they &apos;re che@@ cked over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , you get re@@ mix@@ ed and you have a new book combin@@ ation and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came out to the media lab on a trip , and i could get them to try it out and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of appli@@ cation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
all you have to say is &quot; edu@@ cate words &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people testing it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest be@@ ta@@ -@@ te@@ ster down there on the lower right .
it turns out he was just going to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ able .
so for him they were just building blocks .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ fil@@ ming twi@@ st .
we wanted to develop a language lear@@ ner learning .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by li@@ f@@ ting up the si@@ ft@@ able from the table showing this character .
here he is leaving the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he &apos;s taking a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yeah !
sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other , he can let the characters interact ...
... inv@@ ent his own story .
hell@@ o !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evol@@ ves .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve got time to show you today is a musi@@ cal sequen@@ cer for live performan@@ ces that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in si@@ ft@@ ables as sound , like leadership , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
each one has four different vari@@ ations ; you can choose which one you want to use .
and you can put these sounds in the sequence that you can then put in any kind of pattern .
and you eat them by simply holding a ton@@ e-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted ability to a sequen@@ cing key .
there are effects there that you can change live , like rever@@ ber@@ ation and fil@@ ters .
you connect it to a particular note , and then you tend to hi@@ re it .
and then re@@ arr@@ ange@@ d effects like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that you &apos;re using on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to put the leadership voice in two sequen@@ cing si@@ ft@@ able , and put it in a row , exp@@ and it , and add a little more voice .
now i add a b@@ ass .
now i &apos;m going to do some more dru@@ ms about this .
and now i connect the fil@@ ters to the dru@@ ms so i can navi@@ gate the effect live .
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by thro@@ wing the p@@ ace in one way or the other .
and i &apos;ll just wra@@ p the filter up with the bar@@ re@@ l , a little bit more expression .
i can re@@ frame the sequence as it runs off .
and in doing so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , i can impro@@ v@@ ise them , they exp@@ and or s@@ hr@@ ink them during the course of that .
and finally , i can just bl@@ end the whole sequence by pin@@ ching the lou@@ d@@ star@@ ch si@@ ck@@ able to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is to develop new human interface that fit better to how our brains and bodies work better .
and today i had time to show you some of this new design world and some of the ways we work on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we are at the th@@ res@@ hold to this new generation of ads to interaction with digital media that bring information to our world that cor@@ respon@@ ds to our dem@@ ands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
yeah , good after@@ no@@ on .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
i have to pick it up a little bit , and that &apos;s bio@@ ha@@ cking is just about modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve just been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years now with bio@@ ha@@ cking , and i &apos;ve started this because i just wanted to know more deeply and do it yourself , which i &apos;ve learned in college .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology in general now , generally speaking , bi@@ otechnolo@@ gy , everything you count to syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
extremely important , already is extremely important , and much , much more important is going to be in the future .
there are things as contro@@ versi@@ al as all of these genetic modi@@ fi@@ cations on the cor@@ ners .
there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er now in the u.s. trying to make bio@@ fuel , which is gas@@ ol@@ ine from al@@ ga@@ e .
under then there are things that have come completely everyday , which is not aware of , for example , was@@ h enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h at 40 degrees of laun@@ dry , are also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
and you can continue the list end@@ less@@ ly .
and so from an interest in this technology , i went on .
that &apos;s why ha@@ cking now ?
most people know this from the software range .
computers ha@@ ck , and then it always gets like this in the media , yeah , the ha@@ ck@@ ers break in somewhere and cla@@ ws data and so on .
because that &apos;s kind of sad for the ha@@ cker@@ scene , because that &apos;s not really what it actually started like , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the software ha@@ cker , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , started computer ti@@ les &apos; 7@@ 0s , and that &apos;s what the internet came out of .
and it &apos;s about solving a problem in a play@@ ful , creative , original way .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be just a problem of how things simpli@@ fy , so any problem to ask , and how can you do that or how to do better ?
and it &apos;s just been gener@@ ated with software , but there &apos;s also an electr@@ on@@ ics do@@ main , there &apos;s also a whole ba@@ st@@ ler scene that does all kinds of stuff with electr@@ on@@ ics circu@@ its .
and now i want to take this metaphor that comes from syn@@ thetic biology , which is actually a science of information , because , in fact , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstra@@ ct code that &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s real matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can ha@@ ck it like that , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
it actually only took two thousand eight really shape , these networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a co@@ operation based in india , but has members or active people all over the world now .
these are a more arti@@ stic ori@@ entation , so there are a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and collabor@@ ation with scientists to just sit down and ask questions and work crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really all about trying to find such a smaller access , such a play@@ ful shift .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
this is from the u.s. a network , which is actually more of a kind of for@@ um where you stop and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and they &apos;re also a little bit more business along the way , and then they &apos;re asked , yes , questions applied .
and from these networks that have made the whole popular , stop has this kind of scene that i want to portra@@ y brie@@ fly .
you see here in the upp@@ er left there bio@@ diversity , which is a ha@@ cker@@ space , which is basically a kind of school , such a private school , non-@@ profit contra@@ ct , where everybody can get there .
children , old , all kinds of people go there to just sit down with it , and they set up a lab and look at what can you do if these lab proto@@ col@@ s can .
down here on the lower left is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia called hou@@ se-@@ o@@ f-@@ natural fe@@ ver , but they &apos;ve been around for quite a long time .
for a long time than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also involved in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct of biological materials , and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics ba@@ star@@ ds too , and com@@ bine that in a fairly ab@@ i@@ d@@ ant way .
a group of ank@@ ar@@ a that i met a while ago , who was a student group that wanted to con@@ vey more what she was learning in college , and they were doing so on street little actions and trying to explain to people what that is .
and i have a le@@ cture on the top of the other picture in cop@@ enha@@ gen at the medical museum in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s usually quite young people , but the only thing that really united you is this fascin@@ ation with technology .
and what you can do with it , and you &apos;ve got to go to society and ask , you know , what do you want to do with it , are you interested in bringing you this way ?
so , o@@ .@@ k , to ha@@ ck biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and then that &apos;s a lab .
or what you usually understand under a lab , these are sort of sen@@ ior machines , extremely expensive , highly distance , only for profession@@ als , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with ph@@ .@@ d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , o@@ .@@ k , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every coffee machine has actually higher technology than most lab@@ s , which is really the way it is .
and then , with this pre@@ mis@@ e , with this pre@@ mis@@ e , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england tried to assem@@ ble a minim@@ um ab@@ or , he then took a ste@@ am prin@@ ting co@@ stu@@ me and a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p brea@@ sts , and then he grew bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s been gam@@ ing a sou@@ p that he &apos;s been up too long has been doing .
i then tried to exp@@ and this in my lab at home a little bit , and then i stopped buying secon@@ d-@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and doing a little bit of d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis , trying to do a father &apos;s test , like this , / d.@@ n@@ .@@ a finger@@ prin@@ ting , again .
now that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , actually , but .
down here in this picture , you can see the lab , in terms of leadership , so there &apos;s a co@@ ated gar@@ age with all sorts of lab sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding that the university has r@@ ented , a group in paris that has set up something , and quite success@@ fully , and i want to do some interesting stuff .
and this is bio@@ diversity that just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this one , sort of fol@@ k school , basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively straight , so that &apos;s what people do at home alone , all the way to large , big , larger organizations that are already doing this in institu@@ tion@@ alized form .
but always the approach that it should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we were sort of aware of our self , o@@ .@@ k , there are now us as real scene , and we are online , and we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting and stuff .
and then came from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o or@@ g website of the fo@@ under , and said o@@ .@@ k , we need to really make ourselves real , also make real meet@@ ings , and then organized two events in london , two thousand , 10 , and soon in the u.s. , san francisco .
and then , it was about , yes , o@@ .@@ k , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what is our purpose , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve worked out a co@@ de-@@ o@@ f-@@ condu@@ ct like this .
it was quite intui@@ tive , so everybody just expres@@ sed their wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what makes him stop , then .
there , i think , was a pretty good code .
and we then have that one , not commit@@ ted , but that &apos;s , i think , pretty well done , people are pretty convin@@ ced about that .
and we &apos;ve even tried to bring that back into the acade@@ mic world , but that &apos;s not where it somehow arrived .
so i think we &apos;re from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene , in fact , a step further than the acade@@ mic world .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
a project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land itself was we wanted to make something called an op@@ tical tra@@ p or an op@@ tical br@@ ush .
this is , if you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on you in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and move in that focus , so it &apos;s cap@@ tured like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am basically .
this really works , this is done in acade@@ mic record , and we then thought , o@@ .@@ k , we might get there , then we picked up a web@@ c@@ am that &apos;s scre@@ wed up l@@ ens , fli@@ pped around a micro@@ scope about four times .
you see that down there .
and then we pulled out a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d burn and pulled out the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot yet .
this is another project that &apos;s done from the french group in paris , which is pretty cool .
and he &apos;s got such a , you know , such a brain wave measu@@ re@@ ment device , e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something like that , so he &apos;s been dealing with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
he then set up this hel@@ met there , and in the co@@ operation with the museum , that &apos;s what went on .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors could go in , sit down on this chair , sit down this hel@@ met .
then their bra@@ in@@ waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought or as they thought , their brain waves have gone on different lights in the room .
it was a pretty big project .
another thing from the united states , which has to do with this father &apos;s history , is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is poly@@ mer@@ as@@ e-@@ chain reaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes that you just want to repli@@ cate , d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , re@@ produce frag@@ ments so you can make them visible .
so if i do this now , the pro@@ fil@@ ers go to the scene , go and collect any ha@@ ir@@ spec@@ im@@ ens , and then they do this method , and then they can say , o@@ .@@ k , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like this .
and the machines that do this kind of thing are pretty expensive to buy commercial , the che@@ ap@@ est things are going on at four thousand euro@@ s .
and that &apos;s not in ho@@ b@@ by@@ space , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can do a lot of things .
so this is just an appli@@ cation of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been putting two ho@@ b@@ by@@ ists together and said , o@@ .@@ k , we &apos;re doing this simple and che@@ aper , and then we have just open source , which is fre@@ ely available hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ ics , assem@@ bled this device , and they &apos;re actually now the world &apos;s be@@ a@@ sts of these things .
i think that sort of si@@ x-@@ hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a fra@@ me@@ work where it &apos;s getting more available .
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow ha@@ ck .
a project i started recently was building a gen@@ e-@@ gun .
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , yes , sort of like a air pressure gun that sho@@ ots about that far , two centi@@ meters or something .
you put the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a on gold particles and then the gold particles into this air pressure pi@@ le , and then i shot them on oni@@ ons and then light them up like this .
so the device that you see here has not worked .
but this is my prototyp@@ e like this , but it &apos;s pretty much gone , on this bran@@ ch , pl@@ ug@@ ged it on electr@@ on@@ ics and pressure , and that was pressure , but it was too high , the thing has broken .
and then i took a chicken pen@@ der and i put that on it .
a sa@@ int pen@@ der , if you make it full of water , has enough pressure , so i think 40 to six , i think it &apos;s about it .
and then you can acceler@@ ate the particles very well enough , and then they go into the oni@@ on as well .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euro@@ s up or something like that , sac@@ re@@ l pen@@ der about 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially do@@ able .
so , that &apos;s also the core issue right now of the scene to increase this avail@@ ability of technology and also increase the information and the intelli@@ gi@@ bility that more people can engage .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite little idea of it , and also no chance of really forming it .
because if you just read about it , from secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or saw it yourself .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be an in@@ formed citi@@ zen to be able to make meaning@@ ful decisions in society and talk to you , you need to access knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it in order to do it and understand it .
and that then company in the head@@ words of open sha@@ de and citi@@ zen science .
so , as a citi@@ zen , you &apos;re being able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core issue of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
these are the people who have at least offi@@ cially contribu@@ ted on the website , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ or@@ g website .
it &apos;s a pretty remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;ve also enter@@ ed sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people in there than there actually exist .
so i know some that haven &apos;t contribu@@ ted .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers now , the individual people .
in part , also with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so these places are put together there .
and that &apos;s at the very beginning .
as i said , two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th of it started .
and ha@@ cker spaces , so the computer ha@@ cking spaces , because the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , nin@@ th hundred t@@ 15 .
and this has now become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that have occur@@ red all over the world .
and we &apos;re hop@@ ing , of course , that we &apos;re going to be equ@@ ally exp@@ and@@ ing , and then also quite well connected so that stop getting people involved .
and i would invi@@ te every time to deal with it and try something out of it .
now it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curi@@ osity and put enough energy in there , you get a long way .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi there .
how do we actually work with people ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but also in the research section of us@@ ability and in front of all things in the user experience .
it &apos;s about how you en@@ counter people in inter@@ active media so that they can use these inter@@ active media so they create a possible experience .
because i think that the inter@@ active media in us are add@@ res@@ sing arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programm@@ ed in our biological minds very , very long time ago , and that we can re@@ create them through inter@@ active media .
and it &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that this high technology that you &apos;re en@@ counter@@ ing is actually going to bring you into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us at our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
what are arch@@ a@@ ic models now ?
i wrote up four words once , and i want to explain them brie@@ fly .
in arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models , these are the models that we have adap@@ ted in pre-@@ industrial times .
to these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we have basically a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
that sounds , in principle , unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that in a second and try to prove to you that they also have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the second thing is that since this arch@@ a@@ ic model , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very edu@@ ca@@ tional , even though today we &apos;re using a co@@ di@@ fied language .
and the third area , which actually expla@@ ins itself .
we all know that inter@@ active media by definition non@@ linear , which invol@@ ves lin@@ ear@@ ity &apos;s sense , and what we &apos;re saying , of course , is that we feel lin@@ ear@@ ity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us to trans@@ mit information .
so what about virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that immediately , but this is going to happen , and this is happening right now .
they go through this house in mind , so they live in this house , and look at how many do@@ ors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they virtual reality without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re getting ti@@ red of the media cam@@ pus , for example , repres@@ enting virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ r@@ . lab , where we can actually do it all the time .
and that capacity to virtual reality , that people in the pre-@@ industrial times also needed bit@@ ter , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that mind , memory was happening .
in that mind , knowledge was called down , and using these virtual images , imagination was also passed on .
and so it &apos;s ro@@ ot@@ ed so much that we can deal with virtu@@ ality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
yes , it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time human beings were also media produ@@ cers and media themselves .
now if you think a little further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk about that in a minute .
fundamental tool of information process@@ ing has been stories ever since .
am@@ an@@ as , pri@@ est , so@@ -@@ called knowledge gu@@ ards , were extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong about stories .
the auth@@ or of the book is the story story animal , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ ch@@ all , and we &apos;re still inter@@ fer@@ ing with thousands of hours a year with the reci@@ pe of stories .
that means for a child who has spent most of his life on the pres@@ cri@@ ption of stories until reach@@ ing the great year .
now we think our love of stories depends on we &apos;ve been ser@@ ving as a child on the la@@ p of our parents .
no , no , no , far missing .
that goes much further back into pre-@@ industrial cultures .
but to me , in the field of inter@@ active media as a particularly im@@ pres@@ sive thing is that , by our biological memory , we have announ@@ ced the ability to think non@@ linear .
i brought an example from the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to kind of navi@@ gate there from island to island to get food .
and they did it with what &apos;s called le@@ ad maps .
you may know that , even if you &apos;re a little bit interested in that , of the austr@@ ali@@ an people .
they have similar principles .
they have no le@@ ad maps , they &apos;ve used these nan@@ ted son@@ gl@@ ines or even dream lines .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graphy of regi@@ ons could be edu@@ cated by son@@ gs .
which was the language sub@@ ordin@@ ated by the sub@@ ordin@@ ated ran@@ g .
that means you navi@@ gate over sound and rhyth@@ m .
and these sounds and these rhyth@@ m have been the ge@@ ology that shows to@@ po@@ graphy of a region , and it also allowed , of course , to de@@ frag@@ ment these son@@ gs and put them together differently and move so to the left and back to the right and back to where it was going .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from above to b ?
anyway , not to navi@@ gate .
what happened there ?
what happens is that this is what &apos;s called the machine age .
we moved in what &apos;s called the vo@@ g@@ t age before .
what happened is the machine age , and what happened is the book , and it &apos;s the photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened is that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the production of our individual memor@@ ies in ex@@ ternal media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have god &apos;s a long for@@ mul@@ a to virtual .
virtu@@ ality suddenly has become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bru@@ ce brown , a well-@@ known designer at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet and so on , what we call mass media today , these mass media , have been calling the memor@@ ies of our ability and virtu@@ ali@@ zations .
let &apos;s make a little inter@@ medi@@ ate thing .
from the vo@@ g@@ t age to the machine age .
what has influ@@ ences on our thinking and our memory ?
then the inter@@ connected influ@@ ences of pre-@@ industrial cultures .
and they have been over@@ wrote over the course of cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
so instead of re@@ mind us individu@@ ally , we have standard , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memor@@ ies that we can hang on our personal memor@@ ies .
we no longer produce ourselves .
we have an abstra@@ ct language abstra@@ ct .
we &apos;re not imag@@ ining things in pictures anymore , but we &apos;re co@@ ding you our language .
we were used to things linear .
and we ac@@ cep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as law , and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
what we &apos;ve sta@@ yed in is the story story story .
we &apos;re still very , very ar@@ re@@ sted to story@@ telling as an information process@@ ing .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had this a@@ vi@@ an age , we had the machine age , and we now described this so@@ -@@ called cyber@@ -@@ age .
it sounds very spac@@ ey , and it sounds very like science fi@@ ction , i know .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ -@@ age that bring us that opportunity to re@@ discover our cap@@ abilities .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality ; it &apos;s non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity ; it &apos;s about story@@ telling .
i want to explain that a little bit .
there are technical concep@@ ts like aug@@ mented reality , which means aug@@ mented reality .
so if you look at google glass , for example , it &apos;s such a concept that makes us re@@ com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world , which means our mon@@ in@@ ity to virtu@@ alize the virtual world as something that &apos;s normal , natural .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , that may sound in the context of my talk , as we move physi@@ cally into non-@@ existence , virtual worl@@ ds , according to the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck model .
and other examples are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond intelligent to a human being .
all of this takes the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
i gradu@@ ated , and i hope the video works , brought along a very , very nice project , which is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ or@@ ic work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ n@@ ka@@ thr@@ in kr@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z waste .
and the two last ones are here as well .
maybe you can just stand up for a moment so they can pause with the two of them over the project .
and i brought this project back as an example of how to address this arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive model .
all of this is a game , i have to say to you .
of course , story is extremely opposite , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer game , you &apos;re very likely to have some people sitting in front of any con@@ so@@ le , or playing with some con@@ so@@ le in your hand .
anyway , they do it in there .
this is a game outside .
and this is what i think i discover the outside world , so that i re@@ discover the real world .
and this is a game that conne@@ cts the virtual world , which is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to cut so much .
you can then explain that in a moment much better , there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
and it &apos;s about explor@@ ing a city by looking at which places were posi@@ tively t@@ we@@ et@@ ed or nega@@ tively twi@@ tter@@ ed .
and so i get a very different view from the city , a very different sense , which is that i see negative and positive z@@ ones in a city , and i get a very different virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explan@@ ation of what you &apos;re about to see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of flas@@ h@@ light , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ize my talk once , in the sense that the properties and skills that we &apos;ve ac@@ qui@@ red from the a@@ vi@@ an age , and that have gone away a little bit in the machine age , that we can actually get back to the end of the future called cy@@ ber age and become more complex .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this s@@ ack is a speak@@ er ba@@ g , and i &apos;m going to talk instead .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to dis@@ solve what &apos;s in there in a second .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit curious .
yes , children are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers as well .
i &apos;m a cre@@ ator of house , so of course i &apos;m also involved in the theme of curi@@ osity , and how curi@@ osity also changes our thinking , and why do we maybe lose curi@@ osity and need to re@@ bu@@ mp and so on .
that &apos;s a whole range of things you do bes@@ i@@ des actual existence as a cre@@ ator .
when profess@@ ors get curious , they &apos;re often put into such research se@@ me@@ sters .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a research me@@ ster on natural interface design .
now you &apos;re going to be wonder@@ ing why all the designers begin to engage with such natural arch@@ a@@ ic forms of communication , interaction us@@ w and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up because things should become more intui@@ tive , more natural , us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us humans , what &apos;s us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
and before the background , i was design in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation of human computers in the relationship of the human computer is dealing with how our tools or how the computer is changing from the computer of su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve to the digital assi@@ stant .
so i &apos;ve been bus@@ y doing this , when is it natural or intui@@ tive ?
maybe another look behind it .
why is this happening at all ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , brie@@ fly repres@@ ented here , now we move from the third to the fourth generation of life or society .
so from modern to computer society .
every society is sha@@ ped by a primary medium .
ini@@ tially , tri@@ b@@ al society is language .
that means that you &apos;ve found yourself talking a common language , you &apos;ve been able to communicate with each other , moved to the same ca@@ ve or other areas , edu@@ cated cities or vil@@ la@@ ges and created , in a sense , tri@@ b@@ al society .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you also had to learn , so no small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning , of course , su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve and ra@@ ti@@ o .
that was then dis@@ solved by ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
this was a huge out@@ cry at the time , because , of course , you started mani@@ fest the living language in the form of writing , which means what &apos;s flu@@ id and alive is i start and i set it in stone , and i manipu@@ late it as well .
so depen@@ ding on how i master and when i master , of course , it &apos;s a very different narra@@ tive than if there &apos;s a living sort of thing .
but su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve then moved this scri@@ pt as a primary medium to ac@@ qui@@ re .
then the next generation that we &apos;re actually living in today is pri@@ mar@@ ily .
that &apos;s the pressure and print writing with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
at the time , it was just a mon@@ key , where a@@ del , cl@@ ent@@ us and others have said , are you in@@ san@@ e when the people start reading , then the after@@ wards want to talk , and that &apos;s of course totally f@@ at@@ al .
and now we get to the next generation , and the exciting thing is that we &apos;re just a gener@@ ative shift every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase right now .
that completely conf@@ uses us , of course , because we see on one hand the new media , social media , facebook and so on .
so with total transpar@@ ency , what the new thinking is , what b@@ ange@@ ds on the old thinking , don &apos;t say , in the las@@ ag@@ ne horse meat and no more bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , which is i want to mer@@ ge this and do this at all .
and these two worl@@ ds are just cra@@ w@@ ling together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , re@@ je@@ cts very many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic thinking patterns from tri@@ b@@ al society .
but now not at the local level , but at a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecolo@@ gy is a global issue .
not when i think local ecolo@@ gical here , and the neighb@@ or thinks less ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it won &apos;t work anymore .
so , from the local village , a global village has actually become a global village with the same principles , possible , intui@@ tively , but also complete transpar@@ ency .
as you knew back in the village , who has what happens to whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this expan@@ sion of ourselves through these mobile fin@@ ite devices at a global level .
it &apos;s that we know glob@@ ally acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating and faster and better and better .
just like it happened in the village earlier .
before the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at this , what does it mean for us , what &apos;s still natural for us , what is it that we might have lost , but instin@@ ctively , what makes the difference ?
because people often come , you can &apos;t make it us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly so that anybody can hand@@ le it .
so you have to deal with this , which means , and not just change it , but it &apos;s better to do better .
and when , of course , is a little bit intui@@ tive , and how do i work as a cre@@ ator and design things so that they &apos;re a us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly , so they &apos;re poten@@ tially intui@@ tive , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
you &apos;re looking at it , even during studying , with the subject of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
and that , of course , is what you start looking at and say , okay , now i &apos;m just looking inside the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like in there ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intui@@ tive and how does our chan@@ n@@ els work in perception and how does the cognitive process@@ ing work ?
because steve jobs once said you need to be smart , metaph@@ or@@ ically accu@@ rate .
so you really have to look in detail if i want to make something us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive pal@@ p@@ able , which means at the core .
and there you already see that you have a our seven senses , most people think we have only five , and now it &apos;s even seven of us already , and certainly in the near future , the next a@@ we@@ -@@ meaning , and also exten@@ sion of ourselves .
and to see how do we process information , how do we take information ?
just to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is any difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but don &apos;t know what it means then in detail .
but i have to understand , in essen@@ ce , when is information going to become information , when will information , and from information , again , so i know how to make things intui@@ tive or of course pal@@ p@@ able ?
and of course , how design affe@@ cts perception .
we see this when i design things , i can make them conf@@ using like on the right where i don &apos;t know what s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er is , or i can sort of intui@@ tively design them by showing things .
so much more natural , in a po@@ ol , but i see , in a sense , where s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er is .
and when i tell someone , they give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , they &apos;re going to first think about where &apos;s inside .
and on the left , just intui@@ tively access to me , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , just give me s@@ alt .
but also our per@@ cep@@ tions themselves , how they dec@@ ei@@ ve us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and yet our perception changes depen@@ ding on what context we put things in .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
it should still work .
it &apos;s going to be a little bit more like my glas@@ ses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle begins to cor@@ relate or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
and when i put another hal@@ bo@@ val in there , suddenly we don &apos;t see one more unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , another circle .
this is what &apos;s called shape law , or gest@@ alt psychology , which also affe@@ cts us in perception .
important for the designers , they usually have this in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great fra@@ me@@ work laws .
sha@@ ped law near the continu@@ ity and so forth .
often in the third one , forget about it .
but this is a cru@@ cially important ingre@@ dient when you want to make things intui@@ tively intui@@ tive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is that of vision .
sounds really ban@@ al for the first time , but it &apos;s exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking from the front to the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see the first time from the back to the front .
and that is , they &apos;re proje@@ cting a pro@@ position forward that they see something they recognize , quite an example of circle .
that means we &apos;re only going to get our vision before we see it coming back into our se@@ a@@ we@@ ed machine to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got such cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve tried something that you want to see .
so that &apos;s there , that &apos;s coming back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t look at the front and say , well , look really again and see if what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually only seen .
so a very , very exciting process of how certain things go off and what happens for milli@@ second areas .
i don &apos;t know who this picture is .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
now , everybody from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes this .
does anybody see something particular ?
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , exactly .
once i saw that , that &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now you see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and on , now you see him .
that means i &apos;ve actually spo@@ iled them right now that they no longer recognize patterns in them , but i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned them within a very short period of time to see this dog in this bl@@ ur@@ red picture .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to pro@@ j@@ ie@@ f forward that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
so , very , very exciting processes , which then happens in this , yes , gra@@ y is not actually , but it &apos;s actually not in this ro@@ san@@ e mass right here .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know it takes three seconds to sort of take me out of the present loo@@ p into the past loo@@ p , i can bridge very well wait times when i &apos;m dealing with someone at three seconds .
he has to process that first as the present .
then it goes into the past , so i can bridge very elegan@@ t waiting times , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes fif@@ ty milli@@ seconds ?
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love with .
that means min@@ d@@ set , if you know that now , notice who you &apos;re looking at for a long time , because i don &apos;t take any gun for what &apos;s going to happen .
and six milli@@ seconds , even an exciting phenomenon .
this is the period of most per@@ cep@@ tual per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
that is , this first im@@ pression happens at a ra@@ pid speed of how we percei@@ ve things .
and as we see things that we &apos;re looking at , and how we kind of se@@ cure against our environment so that we can think about them accor@@ d@@ ingly .
of course , the designers are not just concerned with per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ ors or cognitive z@@ ones , but pri@@ mar@@ ily the subject of human object .
so how is a human being about certain things ?
there are times more productive fun@@ ctions , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal@@ a@@ thetic issues .
there &apos;s phone fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where to reach .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , why does anyone spend such a little bit of work , where har@@ dly anything f@@ its in anyway , such hor@@ ror su@@ ms of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more at the symbo@@ lic level , at the meaning@@ ful level , which we , of course , consider ourselves the cre@@ ator .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the subject , of course , is us@@ ability .
us@@ ability always means how can i possibly reach a certain goal , or how can a user achieve a goal in a certain way that is effective , efficient and satis@@ factory ?
that &apos;s what the nor@@ m says .
how can i make something possible to use friend@@ ly ?
can i use that directly or need the n man@@ ual , or i need to have a con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al training for it .
and it &apos;s less us@@ able or us@@ able .
that i &apos;m making this different and beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better pal@@ p@@ able .
you also have to understand that .
and if you look at some of the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll also understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of our software today is not intui@@ tive or not us@@ able to call , the i@@ -@@ pad in many areas or i@@ -@@ phones , though it &apos;s more intui@@ tive than software is .
it &apos;s intui@@ tive us@@ ability not only since apple is a fundamental economic factor , it &apos;s fundamental success factor , if i want to use technologi@@ cal devices to people .
why ?
because in general , through this new kind of us@@ ability , the natural user equ@@ ity , we &apos;re five times faster on average on our goal .
and you have to imagine that if you make something of the classi@@ c cou@@ p , you need five hours and you need this new kind of natural software for just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re likely to go home for probably four hours , but your emplo@@ yer or someone can come up with them on the order of four hours .
but i want to say that for us , of course , it &apos;s a con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al increase in achie@@ ving certain things .
when we go back to software , here &apos;s the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces that were very abstra@@ ct , where it took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next one that &apos;s already been working with &quot; nice neu@@ ral model , &quot; or mental model , like the software e@@ er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists , &quot; which is that you have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to use the computer .
so no longer zer@@ os and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
that made it much more us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly , but , of course , it &apos;s much better .
the next generation of graphic user interface is working a lot more with behavior .
so , as a cre@@ ator , i make a lot more behavior than that .
it &apos;s also such a paradig@@ m shift .
that all of a sudden i look increasingly un@@ important to success , just the us@@ ability becomes an ap@@ p .
and then , if i go one step further into this natural user inter@@ faces , where i voice , language , by touch , by touch , by not mouse and cur@@ sor , i &apos;m even faster and even more immedi@@ ate .
but that brings me back to the point , again , when are things getting more intui@@ tive ?
when you get more intui@@ tive , and then again , i have to pun@@ ish and watch my little friend here , what does that mean from the point of view of cognitive ser@@ gon@@ om@@ y , when is it really something intui@@ tive ?
and this is always a little bit intui@@ tive to us when i have to think about it as little as possible .
so , appar@@ ently , he doesn &apos;t want to think like it , but he just make it rela@@ tional .
the less i think about it , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and what does this mean for designers ?
that means , if we look at exi@@ sting tra@@ ding models of one to another , for example , the metaphor , i can make the growth as a cre@@ ator .
that means i can trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human action model to software and make the software much more us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly .
so , of course , the question is , what is the most intui@@ tive hand sche@@ me of us humans , and now i &apos;ve already reve@@ aled it ?
this is called the o@@ si@@ t-@@ model .
that uses each of us and o@@ f@@ ten@@ times is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and stands for ori@@ entation , sele@@ ctive , in@@ formed , trans@@ action .
that &apos;s what each of you does all the time , but it makes it un@@ consci@@ ously , and it &apos;s sort of intui@@ tively intui@@ tive or instin@@ ctive .
the model is already le@@ ap@@ ed in the wom@@ b and is inter@@ cultural , so it works around the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without most people know that this model is there .
you can see that there &apos;s about 50 to seven thousand times of us ever to activity , so in the sleep , that it &apos;s then being bur@@ ned less often than there is a day .
i can now ori@@ ent this mental action model , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ action trans@@ action system .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , much like the metaphor of the des@@ kt@@ ops , now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a action pattern , of a action spr@@ in@@ kl@@ er .
and this is on a higher degree of user kin@@ dness than the trans@@ mission of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the des@@ kt@@ ops .
and if i trans@@ late that now , for example , where i &apos;m going to ori@@ ent that as over@@ view , sele@@ ctive , in@@ formed as a choice , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , i can tran@@ sc@@ end it , i can throw it in or buy it somewhere .
then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing .
i &apos;ll try this through an example .
everybody &apos;s e@@ aten ca@@ ke .
over@@ sight : now i kind of interact with the object , can zo@@ om out again , zo@@ om in .
i get the whole over@@ view , and i can now filter this and say , just show me all the stuff with cho@@ col@@ ate .
and suddenly , an interface , which is much more intui@@ tive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the pieces , touch things , and they come up to me , is much more natural than if they can do over hierarch@@ ically organized web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms , in a way , make these things available .
imagination is more pr@@ one , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close with you , a and a hin@@ t , also designers have to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense thank you very much for your attention and requ@@ est .
i want to give you a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
the first thing is , when you get big as a child , when you &apos;re a baby , is you take care of what the di@@ vor@@ ces you have , right ? and the more your parents allowed you to play more or less in the po@@ tter@@ y , the more , you know , the more curi@@ osity you &apos;ve got .
and curi@@ osity is not learning .
that &apos;s why those of you who are here and are curious , in fact , people who have a property you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about basically this whole environmental debate , under@@ way , 40 years of clu@@ b@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ ro@@ me , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in it .
and it &apos;s phosp@@ hor@@ us .
give pe@@ e a chance .
every day they give pl@@ ent@@ y of magni@@ tude down about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day they have to pick up two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
we could only gli@@ de as an am@@ or@@ ph@@ an m@@ oll@@ us across the world .
in fact , if we don &apos;t take phosp@@ hor@@ us and ab@@ and@@ on it .
and what &apos;s ast@@ on@@ ishing about this is that we &apos;re dealing with something that &apos;s actually self-@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ bility , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years , and already , through phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing , we &apos;ve brought a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than are used in all the atom@@ ic facili@@ ties .
in the last 20 years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um have been spread on our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , for example , sh@@ at@@ ter the environment , drive less car .
sh@@ it the environment , make less waste .
sh@@ it the environment , use less energy .
this is not protection .
that &apos;s the way i would say , get your child , just beat it three times instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destru@@ ction .
if we think of what the wei@@ gh@@ s to the pi@@ pe , our entire earth will become so@@ on@@ er or later a ce@@ me@@ tery .
that &apos;s why we think about wei@@ gh@@ s .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all .
in the ground , over 6@@ 0s percent of the carbon is stor@@ ed .
right now , we &apos;re building cor@@ n and losing between 11 and 30 kilo@@ gra@@ ms of 30 tons per he@@ ct@@ are , or re@@ calcul@@ ating to the square meter .
that means we lose about five times more than new edu@@ cated in the ground .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
and everything is pac@@ k@@ aging or content .
for example , in open@@ ness , 20 percent of the g@@ arb@@ age is now wind waste .
and as we grow older , wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all sort of in the sub@@ way phase .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand wind@@ mil@@ ls .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is bal@@ an@@ ced in china in a second .
this is completely tri@@ vi@@ al .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind@@ mil@@ ls ?
this pro@@ of , by the way , that men are not pig@@ s .
let me tell you .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is em@@ it@@ ted in the pig@@ s over the soli@@ d ingre@@ di@@ ents .
people over the ur@@ ine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s with this .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , right ?
we think traditional in environmental debate , we &apos;re too many around the world .
and if you re@@ je@@ ct the people who , if you tell people to exist , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , they become re@@ e@@ f and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , says there &apos;s nothing more important than stabili@@ zing the human population .
in israel , if you res@@ cu@@ ed a human life , you res@@ cu@@ ed the earth .
here it says the more you change , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants wei@@ gh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the united states , no one li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es , as far as they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arian .
that means the ants wei@@ gh a lot more than us .
and because they work a lot harder than us , physi@@ cally , because they only live three to six months , they dis@@ agree with their weight , a little tri@@ cky billion people in energy use .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far away we are from what we really wanted to achieve and could , and how sad we are , that we are even on earth , can you see that open@@ ness has a program , for example , ti@@ ll tw@@ ent@@ y , you want to be here cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , right ?
you can only be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be du@@ mber than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
lu@@ ck@@ ily not , yes ?
there &apos;s no population problem with trees .
there are still six billion trees in the ama@@ zon area alone .
have you ever heard about over@@ population problems of trees ?
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be du@@ mber than trees .
and where you see , even in something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ ct bio@@ -@@ agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own met@@ abo@@ lic products to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that really had to go back into cir@@ cles .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ land , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natural pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s , and as they all say , that allow our own ex@@ cre@@ ments to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we &apos;re too many .
it certainly makes sense to be less har@@ m@@ ful in terms of oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our ecolo@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for business , but when it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there , right ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , right ?
you can only have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions if you &apos;re not there .
even if you sho@@ ot yourself now , you would have emis@@ sions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutri@@ ents back .
we do agriculture in brazil where we re@@ gain nutri@@ ents .
we can get nutri@@ ents in agriculture in this way directly .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking the waste directly .
in china , a post-@@ tt@@ op@@ ian is still hon@@ e@@ y@@ ly po@@ tter@@ y , so to speak , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutri@@ ents back .
that means the whole western civili@@ za@@ tional story is that the city has always been increasing , but farmers have never given back .
so the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers had to go to cities , and the cities had to keep moving their nutri@@ ents .
that &apos;s why all the western rich people have always exp@@ and@@ ed until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ ded .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to get civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutri@@ ents back .
even today , even if they &apos;re invited to eat in china , they &apos;re expected to stay until they se@@ ek the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and to get nutri@@ ents .
they were invited to eat , not to feed the@@ ft .
that means you can see on the internet how to re@@ gain nutri@@ ents .
the really nice thing is , if you do that , you know , agriculture , produ@@ ces bio@@ gas , on a he@@ ct@@ ar country with five thousand people in fa@@ vel@@ as , a far@@ mer can produce about a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ dollar economy and the plant waiting for the chi@@ ck@@ ens and a pi@@ g and a vege@@ table and a vege@@ table .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate goes back to fa@@ vel@@ as by over nine percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , we don &apos;t have to control people as little as possible .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-@@ tech agriculture , but the facili@@ ties carry themselves .
the by@@ product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed like this by the design that a far@@ mer can simply farm them .
that is , the crime rates go back .
and none of these facili@@ ties , we have now built over 100 t@@ 50 years , none of these facili@@ ties have ever been sab@@ ot@@ ted .
you could throw in a li@@ ter al@@ le@@ th@@ al so easily , and then it would be ru@@ ined over years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , to be less bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and by the way , if you want to do something about it , write down , in germany most su@@ it@@ able of all the facili@@ ties in fr@@ ance .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not in open@@ ness , but maybe they can help the fr@@ ance a little bit .
because the fr@@ ance plant could best re@@ gain phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and we see that it per@@ me@@ ates .
we have now de@@ plo@@ yed in holl@@ and over three years .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined that it will be the first country in the world to re@@ gain phosp@@ hor@@ us .
but we need it over@@ all .
you know , there are two countries that control nearly se@@ vent@@ h percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us benefits in the world .
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ages .
that &apos;s six and a half countries control 40 percent of the oil supp@@ lies .
and we &apos;re going to be able to re@@ place the oil with other energy whe@@ els .
but the phosp@@ hor@@ us is not going to be re@@ placed .
that &apos;s not about making the exi@@ sting slightly less bad , it &apos;s about doing something right .
and most of all , it &apos;s to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holl@@ and , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand because in holl@@ and the country is built on flo@@ wers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , if your wife is sad , if you an@@ gry her , and you come with 50 ro@@ ses .
completely in@@ efficient .
but it &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a li@@ p pen .
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six com@@ ma three kilo@@ gra@@ ms in her lifetime .
here .
it &apos;s not scienti@@ fically accu@@ rate because we don &apos;t know how much gets k@@ is@@ sed off .
but a li@@ p pen , even in this ligh@@ ting , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but really effective , right ?
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
not to burn the cla@@ im a little bit better , and to de@@ f@@ end it and to lose all the materials for cy@@ cles , but to first ask , how do you make cy@@ cles ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficient .
yes ?
if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a p@@ ill with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; ne ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that is , everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , avo@@ i@@ ding , redu@@ cing .
all the environmental debate .
we tell people , well , you don &apos;t have an environmental awar@@ eness in the south .
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
every place where you throw away , from , yes , you create life opportunities .
but the wrong things .
when you throw away the wrong things , you have a problem of waste .
in how we think from the north .
there &apos;s every foot@@ print there .
when they walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
because the soil is going to die down and the wind and the water wash@@ es the ground away .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means the water &apos;s longer in me@@ a@@ dow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big foot@@ print that becomes a wet@@ lands .
not school management .
we say sustain@@ ability in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
so what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , heart pa@@ vement , right ?
that &apos;s the minim@@ um right now .
so don &apos;t save , avoid .
every waste is nutri@@ ent .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust when you see in it@@ al@@ y , as people in the high ar@@ c are thro@@ wing out co@@ ke can from the car .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s a form of re@@ fourth behavior , right ?
you can show i was there .
but with the right design , there you go .
for example , we developed an ice scre@@ am pac@@ ka@@ ge , which is liquid at room temperature .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , it &apos;s building all over the place .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants so that by thro@@ wing away bio@@ diversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less har@@ m@@ ful at all .
so there are two cy@@ cles that come .
not everything should be com@@ pos@@ able , of course .
a tv station or a wash@@ ing machine , because they just use it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that are wa@@ sting , like sho@@ e sol@@ es , like bra@@ kes , like auth@@ ors , they must be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only being used go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
like the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , right ?
very direct adverti@@ sing , not for the company pu@@ ma per se , but for helping this company make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , if i invi@@ te you to eat and say that &apos;s free of cro@@ ps , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we determin@@ ed what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
not tox@@ ic inside .
it &apos;s all inside , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes with which you can put the car@@ c@@ el start at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an pole and the ru@@ b@@ ber can go into biological cy@@ cles , right ?
all of these are com@@ pos@@ able of them .
and of course , when we do it , we do it for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz and all the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s se@@ wa@@ ge problems caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
that &apos;s why you help with it , ask for people .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed the cha@@ ir@@ man twice now .
and i &apos;m not sure they really stay there .
so , help me with this a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s just been shown .
you can .
we can make things like this now that if they give away , if they break , they can flow in biological cir@@ cles .
technical cy@@ cles are the same .
there &apos;s a direct feedback system for this .
this is the first ecolo@@ gical back@@ pack , which is actually made to go back into the circu@@ lation .
that too , so in every store you can get things back .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the angle again ?
now , when it &apos;s the waste .
all over the place , these win@@ ds are close .
in the countries where people come to money .
it &apos;s on the de@@ pos@@ it , but it &apos;s also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the pla@@ stics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water stor@@ age , inside , that you can just go back to cell@@ u@@ lo@@ si@@ c basis , you can plant 100 trees with a baby in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a .
yes ?
just when you take these ge@@ ars , you s@@ hr@@ ink , steri@@ li@@ ze and you take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees .
so the baby is carbon positive for all life , from the very beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be climate positive .
it &apos;s sort of a fo@@ g@@ gy po@@ op print .
yeah , so to speak .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can rein@@ vent everything again .
i started an institute on this .
now , a lot of people work there , and they can all engage .
there &apos;s extra clu@@ bs to cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le , where everybody can join .
so no longer save , avoid , reduce , not de@@ bt management , but intelligent waste .
does this matter ?
thank you .
the work of interpre@@ ting it .
music as a language .
in the descri@@ ption of my speech , i said that as an interpre@@ ter , i am an interpre@@ ter , so in english word sense , i understand .
interpre@@ ts are trans@@ lat@@ ors of the written notes in clinical music .
not only do you trans@@ late the word for word into another language , but you also have to understand the deeper sense of the words and word bi@@ as so that there is a useful trans@@ lation , anyone who has to do with foreign languages .
trans@@ lation from ger@@ man@@ s into english can require more knowledge , once you think about poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s fre@@ ely for la@@ y@@ as to what we do with our music language to musi@@ cians .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music , i first have just the written notes .
you think the com@@ pos@@ er has put everything into the notes , which he came up with .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue and in@@ accu@@ rate .
these notes are about the same , or in@@ accu@@ rate as a verb@@ al , even though very seem@@ ingly pen@@ i@@ ous , descri@@ ption of a landscape .
because in this verb@@ al landscape descri@@ ption , the smell of flo@@ wers is not to smell , the degree of the green , not to hear the colum@@ n of the wind , not feel .
that means that the interpre@@ ter has to trans@@ late this in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble sequence of not@@ ation into another , nam@@ ely audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non@@ verb@@ al music language .
today i want to trans@@ late to you what else i &apos;m doing , which is interpre@@ ting , again , into a verb@@ al language .
so basically a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so i pre@@ fer to do the whole thing in ger@@ man , because if i had to trans@@ late it into english again , it would be important for me to trans@@ late the trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so , the music works for me the same as spo@@ ken language .
the notes have the function of the letters of a scri@@ pt .
so it &apos;s not enough to just learn to read notes and press the keys on the pian@@ o or the right place on a vi@@ o@@ lin string .
because these would be just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letters you only see when you can make the language .
so for the learning process of music , you need at least as long as spo@@ ken language .
there are also sub@@ tra@@ ctions , whether you can learn it for use , just passi@@ vely under@@ stands or ac@@ tively speaking to the musi@@ cal na@@ tive na@@ tive speak@@ er .
the work of interpre@@ ting starts kind of like a theater dire@@ ctor course .
after you first cho@@ se to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you study for back@@ gro@@ unds of com@@ position .
you collect information about the piece in the secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
you read them in the letters , the journ@@ als , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ ers themselves .
you study the work he &apos;s com@@ posed before and after .
you compare them .
the cause of writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
what were its circum@@ stances , like society and politics ?
i &apos;m interested in all this .
you &apos;re thinking in that time by looking at con@@ temporary images , for example , or reading liter@@ ature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also been interpre@@ ted as a rich knowledge to feel the com@@ pos@@ er you &apos;re playing more often , and it &apos;s getting easier and easier to come in and feel inside .
the com@@ pos@@ er becomes more and more a friend that you live with .
his cause of writing the piece becomes increasingly and more about my personal cause to play it .
now that the notes are anything but an accu@@ rate record of the com@@ pos@@ er , but a fra@@ me@@ work , i &apos;m now turning this sc@@ aff@@ old to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish it with meaning and meaning .
so i say in my own words , what could be written between this sc@@ aff@@ old ?
i &apos;m expla@@ ining what these sounds might have to mean .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er back then , and what you might mean now for him today .
every note , every phr@@ ase gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself because it comes out of my right now .
it has to be co@@ her@@ ent to me and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s a very happy conc@@ ert over and over again , if i may have the experience , the play that i &apos;ve been working in ad@@ v@@ ance as long as i can experience new .
as you see a happy new day , although with the same ri@@ tu@@ als of life , they get up , they go to work , i do the same thing over and over again .
i &apos;m older again , changing seas@@ ons , my pul@@ se goes slo@@ wer in the morning , in a conc@@ ert room it takes longer for the sound to come back than at home .
i &apos;m reali@@ zing the audience &apos;s brea@@ thing , consci@@ ously or un@@ conscious .
all this influ@@ ences me and all of this also affe@@ cts my experience with com@@ position .
and it &apos;s wonderful when i &apos;m standing on stage with a du@@ o partner , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
then the same thing happens in a good , appropriate conversation .
you bring a new idea in , and that &apos;s how it gets ans@@ wer@@ ed with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we haven &apos;t tried so well and you can &apos;t sam@@ ple .
it &apos;s great fun to make music this way , and then as the audience , you have experienced the music communic@@ ating alive .
so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
i &apos;m never going to play the same as this moment .
i can &apos;t play the way i play today in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore i &apos;m going to have a lot more color chan@@ ces of emotions and emotions than we have today .
sur@@ ely , i &apos;m going to throw out some color po@@ ts as well , but get new ones .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a pian@@ o cur@@ su@@ s for music students in my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ elt u@@ de , a well-@@ known bee@@ tho@@ ven@@ -@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and long-term professor of music college here in student school .
unfortunately , i was too young so that when i finally started studying it .
but i was very lucky to meet him at age three , and so i was already in his clas@@ ses at the time of high school .
i was se@@ vent@@ h when i went back to one of his clas@@ ses and played the last of the four bal@@ la@@ ds of ch@@ op@@ in , a late piece .
he asked me what was the introdu@@ ction of this bal@@ la@@ d for me .
it &apos;s such a contra@@ cted part .
and in my ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence , i said expe@@ c@@ tation .
that &apos;s when he was cr@@ us@@ hing and like , &quot; so ? &quot;
that must be the difference of aging .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over 6@@ 0s .
well , with se@@ vent@@ h , you have dreams , but no significant memor@@ ies .
i play the piece today every few years , and it &apos;s changed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because over and over again i read something new .
an example of this from a very different area . mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ ero@@ sis x-@@ times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different days , in different light .
he trans@@ fer@@ red the ro@@ ses in a different way , as he saw them , as they worked on him at that moment .
his personal im@@ pres@@ sions of the sea ero@@ ses .
the x-@@ former interpretation of a piece is compar@@ able to that .
by now , i &apos;m older than ch@@ op@@ in , at age two and a half , when he wrote that piece .
he lived only nine and a half years .
and it &apos;s important for me to look into the notes over and over again , even though i think i can memor@@ ize them .
to keep twi@@ n practic@@ es right with the com@@ pos@@ er .
because the notes are the only connection with him .
especially when it &apos;s already died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , it takes about as long as spo@@ ken language to do .
you know , often the music class is that you first learn to read the notes .
you learn to read prac@@ tically first before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fing@@ ers are in time and right the way the notes are moving , then sound comes out , sounds together like music .
when that happens fail@@ less@@ ly , the student gets the next hard piece .
interpretation is bar@@ ely spo@@ ken in early education .
all right , there &apos;s a quick piece in the front of the pre@@ st@@ o .
len@@ to , slow .
l@@ oud and head@@ mark , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
but even if you trans@@ late that information , it rema@@ ins just a little bit of technical .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very basic .
nam@@ ely , to make music on the instrument , to do its own musi@@ cal do and feel present before .
that &apos;s sing@@ ing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn sing@@ ing because it didn &apos;t pre@@ tend to parents , it won &apos;t do it by itself .
it &apos;s like learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , and then have it over another way to sound about an instrument .
people who &apos;ve never felt anything that &apos;s immedi@@ ate with their own body , like making a sound .
making a phr@@ ase with its own breath .
because the music instrument is the exten@@ sion of our bodies .
our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the pian@@ o are the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers .
mel@@ o@@ dy comes from the healthy and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
the en@@ during report today with music is not there .
you don &apos;t need to make music yourself if it gets bor@@ ing .
no longer need to whist@@ le or sing a lo@@ an .
every single music is being made when you &apos;re constantly su@@ ed by the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i ask you , can &apos;t you sing a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to see if they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little mus@@ cles that hi@@ re the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds , right ?
you can train that .
or c , because they &apos;ve cle@@ an@@ ed it to them , they &apos;re in@@ tra@@ ctable .
and then i ask , how pe@@ er-@@ comp@@ et@@ ent was this diagno@@ sis ?
have you already gotten a second or third opini@@ on , as you say today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you want to have ni@@ x .
but what i would regre@@ t then , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
but maybe you can still dis@@ agree with them .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be an ex@@ cep@@ tional can@@ di@@ date .
but please don &apos;t say anything , i don &apos;t understand classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody says it doesn &apos;t know if it ta@@ stes to me because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
now , they &apos;re not cooking because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so they don &apos;t have to ci@@ te classi@@ cal music either because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether it ta@@ stes to you or not .
whether the music is too whist@@ led or too swe@@ et .
tell what you feel .
over time , you get spra@@ yed , and you want some more sp@@ ices to ur@@ ge or even taste fine differences .
why am i now asking my audience to ac@@ tively listen ?
because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
an art@@ work you never look at has no force to work .
the food that was coo@@ ked by a chef or a chef needs to be e@@ aten and not only looked at or swa@@ pped out of reci@@ pes .
so please listen when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice so@@ und@@ scap@@ e .
if in an environment where adults make ac@@ tively music , or at least listen to active music , a child gro@@ ws up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flo@@ wer have ?
can you play them in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a memor@@ ial , instead of having a red flo@@ wer before .
and that sounds very different than before .
that was the very first start of a musi@@ cal expression .
so the first step in an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred , or even three hundred years ago ?
mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments have pro@@ gr@@ essed .
there was no pian@@ o as an instrument at all .
it just wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed if he had had the sound possibility of today &apos;s modern pian@@ o .
i can now sound the no@@ tions that the stream has had on the modern wing to sound what a b@@ aro@@ que c@@ em@@ bal@@ o cannot do .
bee@@ tho@@ ven also you know he heard more than he had already turned dea@@ f .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything that an orche@@ str@@ a has re@@ je@@ cted from then as un@@ play .
so the com@@ pos@@ ers rely on us interpre@@ ts that rein@@ vent the pieces .
so they can be heard , which they &apos;ve just come up in the mind .
and also , what you would think today in your mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what en@@ vy is ?
have you ever been je@@ wish ?
and how did that feel ?
su@@ ck .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
when i come , with my little v pi@@ es@@ el and i &apos;m wrong , that feeling comes up .
i &apos;m sho@@ ot@@ ing something through my head .
i say , ul@@ f , what &apos;s the big car you need ?
that &apos;s actually half his value in the first year .
and anyway , you work much less than me .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
and then i come to mind immediately , that &apos;s un@@ fair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice is this aw@@ k@@ ward feeling away .
our organis@@ m has invented a great way of making such in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent feelings as en@@ vy simply to disappe@@ ar .
you can try it with words like reven@@ ge or w@@ inn@@ ing or something .
i want to explain something to you today about this mechan@@ ism , or something that you &apos;re un@@ aware of .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you might have heard it when people say no one has an in@@ tent to build a wall .
and then he to@@ wers st@@ ones up so he can lock them up .
you see at such a lie that the li@@ ar itself doesn &apos;t believe what it says .
it &apos;s very easy to see that it &apos;s very different in mind .
it &apos;s just fo@@ ol@@ ing you and not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with fo@@ ol@@ ing yourself .
you need that lie to susta@@ in a lie to susta@@ in self-@@ de@@ ception .
they can make them less easy , yes , check , or even bring them down .
you need time .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you may know .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once portra@@ yed a woman .
this woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it wouldn &apos;t look like her .
pic@@ as@@ so answers , just wait .
they &apos;re getting more and more similar .
at this point and when you lau@@ gh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to know something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a dis@@ connected relationship with lying .
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is telling you something in such a portra@@ it that you &apos;re only going to become familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this art@@ work over and over again .
and then that aw@@ k@@ ward feeling disappe@@ ars , because it doesn &apos;t look like you and it &apos;s getting more similar to you .
here you have this mechan@@ ism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our lifest@@ yle .
and not only in art , but in vol@@ can@@ ic clas@@ ses , in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it appe@@ ars again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful thing in the country ?
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty comes out of that true out@@ come , even the mirror cannot lie from that true out@@ come .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand with political poli@@ cing over and over again .
we need this lie at this point that hol@@ ds us on de@@ ception without which we can &apos;t even live .
not only do we have in art , in vol@@ k@@ s@@ mic poetry , but also in science such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bis@@ cho@@ p of word che@@ ster .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and human ance@@ stry .
that the human being should come from the mon@@ keys and , yes , there would be at least a common ance@@ st@@ or between people and mon@@ keys .
and then she ran up to her husband and said that &apos;s probably not true what charles wrote .
the human being is supposed to come from the mon@@ keys or have a common ance@@ st@@ or .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people from getting knowledge of it .
why do we have to stop people getting knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
because without these li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods we can &apos;t live .
because we have this self-@@ del@@ u@@ sion , this sense of being great , des@@ cent of the highest beings , not of such a natural level , of something un@@ predi@@ ctable like an organis@@ m that still exists to make a stone compar@@ able and otherwise , which is un@@ sustainable for us .
so , we can &apos;t make these things at all .
we need to stop people getting knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechan@@ ism resol@@ ves and what the tra@@ ces it leaves behind , leading to something different than this great picture of ourselves , i want to get you to another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told about a student .
an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
she li@@ kes him especially because he has a slo@@ pe for sin@@ cer@@ ity .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire service .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re hot@@ ter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral justi@@ fication is using the word , we should try to re@@ place it with the word .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the out@@ come .
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t care about fire sol@@ ving .
he &apos;s interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no clu@@ bs to which we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
there he sig@@ ned up .
and bes@@ i@@ des that , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to put fir@@ es anywhere and be happy when the fire comes up after@@ wards .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of cle@@ an@@ ing the dan@@ gers , the others create when they lay fire .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
this sugge@@ sti@@ on that inside the bu@@ b had already known that it was actually related to fire , but he can &apos;t say that l@@ oud .
here you have this cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious one that is going on right away without the fact that you can do something about it , and the things you know look very different , designed to sound much better for you and others .
so just those words that we &apos;re using over and over again in the language of poli@@ tically correct speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know , when we say that , social rela@@ tions are very de@@ lic@@ ate .
we can &apos;t do that simply .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that should work .
so let me show you what we found at my institute .
according to the lo@@ gic , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in un@@ conscious ways that it &apos;s val@@ id to spread out .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example requires what many of you know and some of you appreci@@ ate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the sou@@ l .
what &apos;s the sou@@ l ?
the sou@@ l is such a thing as a mental thing , says about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not ga@@ v@@ c , material nature .
and if you have people who are per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve that they have a sou@@ l , or you can also say , they think they &apos;ve been brought from the sou@@ l to life , then they think it &apos;s kind of , like the sou@@ l , a spiri@@ tual fra@@ me@@ work , not from the earth , from them .
and so , from that sou@@ l , you think that somehow in this clou@@ dy nature , in this funny nature , anim@@ a , it &apos;s in la@@ tin , which is present .
and then , when this magni@@ fi@@ cent object po@@ ps over people , it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that can only live with sou@@ l .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of what the sou@@ l does .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the human .
so we need to percei@@ ve them as something that is supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have this predi@@ ction in front of you , you can understand the lo@@ gic that we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing this happiness through a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a three-@@ sentence .
three of them still know from school .
this is now a three-@@ sentence that descri@@ bes a lo@@ gic .
this is the har@@ dest part of my talk , by the way .
here you need some lo@@ gic , but you also need to lie the will@@ ing@@ ness .
and that is , lying so that you can just get this lo@@ gic wrong .
there are three sent@@ ences in that three-@@ sentence .
the first sentence is clear , there are no sou@@ l .
so the second sentence is , if sound is right , it has no sou@@ l .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted him in particular here .
a third sentence that appe@@ ars immediately in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
they say who has no sou@@ l , who is dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and that &apos;s where you feel it .
here comes this lo@@ gic in this , yes , in this de@@ cep@@ tive talk , to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally correct .
because i can say anything .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a point about reality .
i can say the instru@@ ctor is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the instru@@ ctor is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the instru@@ ctor is not a man .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make any stat@@ ement about what &apos;s true .
i can say anything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s right .
so if sound says there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no sou@@ l .
these things are logi@@ cally correct .
and now our fo@@ ol@@ ing mind feels inst@@ antly , and you can make something out of it .
it ad@@ ds up a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences and pre@@ ten@@ ds to be the opposite of the first sentence already pro@@ ven and as@@ sum@@ ed .
because we actually have to prove whether or not there &apos;s the sou@@ l .
but with this lo@@ gic , which simply uses two sent@@ ences to be reas@@ on@@ ably correct , and a third one that looks like he &apos;s having something to do with it , so we can save our li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods .
so , we pre@@ tend it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a sou@@ l .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example that kee@@ ps fil@@ ling da@@ y@@ care new@@ spa@@ pers .
this is another philosop@@ hi@@ cal top@@ ic , a perman@@ ent burning from philosoph@@ y , is present .
this has to do with going back to the fourth century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that , the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ sche es@@ el named .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ese es@@ el is an es@@ el made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have these sou@@ l .
this is such a natural thing .
and if you place the ex@@ act thing in the middle between two equ@@ ally large ha@@ ves , he &apos;s hun@@ gry .
because he doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack to go to first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how nature pres@@ ents things .
equ@@ ally large forces with current sig@@ ns dis@@ solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if it makes a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack larger immediately , it doesn &apos;t need reason and it doesn &apos;t need anything .
auto@@ matically , he wal@@ ks to the right mind .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , determin@@ ed by the larger pi@@ le that attra@@ cts you immediately , then you also quickly feel that there must be something like free will .
and if we &apos;re already here in fr@@ ance at the main , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ck institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and they sometimes say wol@@ f sing@@ er , there &apos;s no freedom for free .
now we can make the second sentence again and say , if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , he has no freedom for free .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely lo@@ gical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper , find that in that third sentence .
it looks something like this , who has no freedom of will not be able to be attra@@ cted to his actions and cla@@ ims of responsibility , and therefore un@@ accoun@@ table .
here you have it again .
actually , the first thing you have to do is prove whether there &apos;s such a thing as free .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend that the first sentence of forward is wrong , of course , as if you had to assu@@ me the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything yourself if you want to test anything yourself , and particularly if you want to make people happy , you can practice that coura@@ ge to lie .
practice , for example , once you meet a human being that you can say , there are no predi@@ ctors .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ ctors , which is called prop@@ he@@ t .
you cannot call that , that would be a little bit poli@@ tically in@@ correct .
you know , there are no predi@@ ctors .
immediately they will experience one that , of course , such predi@@ ctors , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you already have a problem .
because while you &apos;re bus@@ y trying to make sure you can &apos;t prove that there are no predi@@ ctors , the man is quite happy .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he fo@@ ol@@ ed them .
because he led it to a fi@@ ber where he doesn &apos;t stop himself from .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free from the need to prove that there are predi@@ ctors .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting the bur@@ den of evidence , you &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing the brilli@@ ance of lying .
and once again , if you have such a way to feel that three-@@ sentence in other people , you do it because you will make others happy if you don &apos;t remember them that way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good after@@ no@@ on .
i allowed myself to ask li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the per@@ form@@ ers here from this great event , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and give my idea price .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it with me , it was hard to talk about my idea at first .
and i may imagine my island project , i &apos;m trying to introduce you to .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum full , lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably hearing these nice two girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has been looking for this bad o@@ ko image because i &apos;ve already started studying machine construction in car@@ l@@ bo@@ u , technical school , i think , today .
and then i moved to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d-@@ 8@@ 0s because i wanted to do rene@@ w@@ able energy , and it didn &apos;t exist in kar@@ l@@ s@@ he .
there was le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ ped at the core research plant .
they were all called k@@ f@@ a at the time , and the je@@ wish was called k@@ f@@ a .
they are now proje@@ ctors .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but something like &apos; n solar pen@@ dul@@ um that comes out of the square meter , which was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a person that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated the word again because after the ma@@ son@@ ry , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything on the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the early days .
there was just one of them that was self-@@ admini@@ ster@@ ed alternative oper@@ ations , and one of them was sitting in cross mountain in the multi@@ -@@ y@@ ard where you sus@@ pe@@ cted the evil .
the place of terror@@ ism , but that was called the b@@ old b@@ ars and wind and solar , and that &apos;s where i started in the mi@@ d-@@ 8@@ 0s .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve been told today tou@@ ches me very , because many , many beautiful expres@@ sions were in the process that i &apos;ve lived through .
i worked in the collective for 11 years , which was gras@@ s@@ roots democratic .
we were 20 people .
when one said no , the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ zi@@ p was that completely cr@@ us@@ hed you , and for 10 years , i &apos;ve strug@@ gl@@ ed to see if i &apos;ve wa@@ sted my great engineering study maybe really to make a we@@ ak thing , because all my collea@@ gue &apos;s money , you &apos;ve always spo@@ ken to him .
it &apos;s about meaning .
and this was really , really bit@@ ter , and you also come into this phase , and it just showed up a picture where i asked myself for 10 years , thousands of d mar@@ row , which was then , base wa@@ ges , colle@@ ctively , if this should be really great .
and then i stopped ti@@ ll six and a half and a half , and then along with friends , we became the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on , which became one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world with sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ .
a huge story of success , but again , we have the problem of a growing entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r , and then we have two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start again and go back and look at the next top@@ ic of the future , and that means , i think , that &apos;s crazy .
and here i brought you a project i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , yes , how to get 100 percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and we &apos;ve just started asking a relatively simpli@@ stic crazy story , where could you use a memory meaning@@ ful today ?
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ors .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
that &apos;s five percent rene@@ w@@ able energy share today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
it just doesn &apos;t work technologi@@ cally .
when they &apos;re growing more wind power to each other , the system starts to fail .
i always tell the politicians that when they occu@@ p@@ y our facili@@ ty in ber@@ lin ad@@ ler sh@@ ard .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physi@@ cally seen the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , does it calcu@@ late two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th of 2006 , started the first cont@@ acts with the island , just run through it .
how big a battery would have to be , in fact , to get an island like this to 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even se@@ vent@@ h percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go another slide .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electrical performance are built on the same basis in the world .
this is the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s particularly quick everywhere .
the world &apos;s energy hunger , which is happening , is wi@@ ped out with this , because you don &apos;t need per@@ mission .
it &apos;s fast .
you put a box like this .
and then it usually looks like this .
and over the course of three of these , two of them are always wa@@ ited .
yeah , this is what one looks like down there is the bur@@ den .
we also got very deta@@ iled data .
and the wind power plant , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only store in small quanti@@ ties here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
this is going to get back@@ -up and wind , and the sun &apos;s bur@@ den so they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ able energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off this one .
that means , at the moment , you have to make sure that rene@@ w@@ ables can sort of take over the web .
of course , you can only do that if you &apos;re man@@ ned in some way here .
no one has done that in the world .
that &apos;s a little style , so you can also use your ra@@ z@@ ors in the car over a little switch ju@@ dge .
people always ask me , what do you actually do research in ad@@ ler sh@@ ard ?
that &apos;s already happening .
but if you want to ga@@ ther up multiple of these conver@@ sa@@ tions and build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was to get to se@@ vent@@ h to nine percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then re@@ main that rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able , is going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work out of bat@@ teri@@ es .
it &apos;s certainly going to be a energy system , which then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , or table , that will be it .
so you have to go more to a seas@@ onal memory and comp@@ en@@ sa@@ te winter summer and not just ta@@ g-@@ night .
we just wanted to know what about a normal electro@@ chemical battery .
how far do you get ?
and then did a whole bunch of simulation .
and they simul@@ ated wind and sun and the bur@@ den and came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting result that , after 20 years , you have to get out of the conven@@ tional system at about 50 cents a kilo@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour at about 40 cents per mile .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the same system if the same price goes up five percent a year .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the insu@@ lin lan@@ ders .
what would all have to be done ?
i negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i se@@ arch@@ ed new social she@@ ep .
we were only five people then to re@@ build society .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation again .
the brown is kind of the conven@@ tional system , the green one is our system .
now , our system also has a price rise is that we &apos;re still going to do 20 percent with this , and we &apos;re not going to go through a price increase in the other things .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , which is the power u@@ tili@@ ty company on the island , is what we love to find .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hal@@ le in ber@@ lin where we could sort of map the electric rate of the island of one to three very pre@@ cis@@ ely .
that is , we went for the first time to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
this comes naturally from asia , where the tra@@ p is from japan .
and funny , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , it was developed at bb@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , today , and then ex@@ ecu@@ ted to the japanese .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery you can see .
it &apos;s got a me@@ ga@@ watt power , and it can get that power for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of got out of simu@@ lation .
and then they set them up .
we also have one of these same ag@@ gre@@ gate that he &apos;s standing there , put it in the hall to actually simu@@ late the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hal@@ f-@@ way now , there &apos;s this el at the back here , there &apos;s the big battery that we &apos;re all around the web .
over here , we simu@@ late the whole trans@@ mission system , the kilometer physics of c@@ able , to sort of map the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior on the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kilo@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics onto the net .
here we see this again , this again , the whole , individual ag@@ gre@@ gate .
and what we &apos;ve done since two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th was the ne@@ ck finished , until today , two thou@@ sand@@ th of all that was between the individual system of electr@@ on@@ ics to develop software , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not a battery maker , we &apos;re defin@@ ing ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the subject of battery and the top@@ ic and everything in between .
you &apos;ve got to communicate to the battery , of course , you &apos;ve got to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is , on this island , you can basically take away everything that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables .
so this whole discus@@ sion of how to move back and forth right now , energy turn , how to go , on the island , we have , for example , five to 30 percent accu@@ rate energy energy , so we &apos;re ti@@ l@@ ting the wind and the sun .
natural light then off@@ ers smart gri@@ d .
so smar@@ t-@@ gri@@ d , a huge subject everywhere .
we can start to inte@@ gra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility on the island , ask about , because you can manage the bur@@ den .
that is , if you &apos;re seven percent rene@@ w@@ able , you &apos;re not going to be able to do that without memory .
you can hear by &apos; n smar@@ t-@@ gri@@ d , you can do that by exp@@ and@@ ing the nets , yes , you should definitely do that , but you will never be able to completely dis@@ pen@@ se on memory .
and this is the n bi@@ te the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn off this el , you don &apos;t have this spinn@@ ing mass that causes certain in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the web .
and our european network is basically just made out of l@@ oud ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of big power plants , wh@@ er@@ ever the wave goes all over europe .
we look in this web , we see the 50@@ th her@@ tz , and when it becomes nine her@@ tz nine , we catch up some val@@ ves , then a little bit of a mer@@ h goes in , we come back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible work .
if you te@@ ar it down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spi@@ der reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , you can re@@ act to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , that ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , you have to re@@ place that with produ@@ ctivity electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemistry .
and we can turn two milli@@ seconds into it with this big battery .
and you can see that there are enormous speed opportunities .
and the message is , we need to get those ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we kind of t@@ wen@@ ties , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach them at all .
then we have to te@@ ar off our mu@@ st-@@ run capacity on the net .
mu@@ st-@@ run means the power plant is just running to keep the frequ@@ ency .
yes , this is a huge debate right now , because we don &apos;t have any power plants , or ga@@ stri@@ es , because it &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can break down the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity by putting electro@@ chemical stor@@ age on the net as well .
now , fortunately , there are a whole lot of studies for that .
and to that purpose , people always come and look at our experim@@ entation , sort of our island test .
and yes , the discus@@ sion is always about the question of how far can you take away a piece of future ?
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years have been similar to the discus@@ sion that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years on photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
don &apos;t go , it &apos;s in@@ san@@ e , it &apos;s child play , it &apos;s all we calcul@@ ated , never calcu@@ late .
we have 30 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts today photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany .
this is pre-@@ model .
and i just think that in the next 30 years we &apos;ll have the same capacity for electro@@ chemical stor@@ age all over the world .
very simple , this is how it &apos;s going to come .
there will be a whole bunch of resi@@ stance and argu@@ ments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve been experi@@ en@@ cing , in the last two years , the scientists are going to step on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million fund@@ ing projects now to cli@@ mb 10 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery now to the ger@@ man net .
this will take place next apri@@ l .
so , from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that defen@@ se to that , to that idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able yes .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like an au@@ ste@@ al system .
so far , in discus@@ sions , this insu@@ lin lan@@ er is always trying to do something like this : they have a own little net , which has nothing to do with our connection .
the question is , quite simply , if you &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or ur@@ ani@@ um energy that &apos;s dri@@ ll@@ ed out anywhere in the world and then you &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s available to the sun and the wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a reas@@ on@@ able energy supply , and i &apos;m cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le also gr@@ ate@@ ful that they said , use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in@@ so@@ far , the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um kol@@ a , is that you can be a collective and use solar energy again , put together a little bit .
and yeah , i just want to encoura@@ ge you to be a little crazy , and also have a vision .
and you really have to be pretty tough about it , but i think it &apos;s going to work .
thank you .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , col@@ om@@ n@@ ist of the los angeles times , went through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pa@@ thetic , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , who played on a vi@@ o@@ lin that had only two more str@@ ings .
many of you will know the story , because from ste@@ ven &apos;s article later became a book that was fil@@ med with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or when steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x was a na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers who ended up studying his ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le career in a multi@@ pli@@ c@@ -@@ conser@@ va@@ tive way .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , suff@@ ered a break@@ down , and 30 years later , he lived as hom@@ eless people on the streets of sk@@ id row at the center of los angeles .
i re@@ com@@ mend reading ste@@ ves &apos;s book , or looking at the film , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful conne@@ c@@ te@@ dness that occur@@ red between these two men , but also how music helped make that connection and how it was the instrument when that word game is allowed to get the al@@ than@@ e off the street .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , when wal@@ t dis@@ ney is a hall .
he &apos;d just heard a demon@@ stration of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never get it into the base@@ ball series , and all of this because of the d@@ ory pas@@ sage of the first stage of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first sentence .
we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email that said that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me in education of their own .
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ je@@ cted a medical treatment because he had already been treated with electric sho@@ cks and with th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and tra@@ ils , a trau@@ ma that followed him all his life .
as a con@@ sequence of this , he &apos;s now particularly vulner@@ able to these schizop@@ hren@@ ic ph@@ ases . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes away in the streets of sk@@ id row , always ex@@ posed to this hor@@ ror and tor@@ ture qu@@ als of his own mind .
and in this same kind of ri@@ ce stage , na@@ than@@ iel was when we started with our first lesson in wal@@ t dis@@ ney hall . he had this in@@ san@@ e fle@@ eting in his eyes and worked completely out .
he talked about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke and how someone wanted to po@@ ison him in the sleep .
i was afraid , not because of my opini@@ on , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could fall into one of his states , and that i could destro@@ y him his relationship with the vi@@ o@@ lin if i started talking about cla@@ ims and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting shapes of the di@@ ac@@ e@@ do@@ s .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vi@@ o@@ lin conc@@ ert .
and while i was playing , i realized that there was a whole change going on in na@@ th@@ ani@@ te &apos;s eyes .
it was like he was standing under the impact of an invisible drug z@@ ne@@ i , a chemical response that cat@@ aly@@ st was my game .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ te &apos;s man@@ ic an@@ ger turned into understanding , into a quiet curi@@ osity and gra@@ titude .
and like a mira@@ cle , he took his vi@@ o@@ lin and began playing some cli@@ ps of vi@@ o@@ lin in@@ conc@@ ert , and then asked me to finish it : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ sha@@ i@@ co@@ w@@ sk@@ i , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
we then started talking about music from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ers and all the other bs , from bar@@ to@@ k to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ c@@ ca .
and i realized , not only did he pos@@ s@@ ess an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but connected it to her a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i otherwise know about my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used man who &apos;d just moved through the streets of los angeles , became a de@@ ar , trained , exc@@ ell@@ ent , in ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard trained musi@@ cian .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means bl@@ ur@@ ry health .
because the music allows him to re@@ form his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he es@@ cap@@ es his tor@@ turing conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that &apos;s why we make music : so that we can put something inside us all , our feelings , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity to really shape .
and the reality of that expression reach@@ es all of us and moves , inspired and united us .
what na@@ than@@ iel did was bring him back to a community of friends .
the dis@@ in@@ spir@@ ing power of music brought him back to a family of musi@@ cians who understood his talent and saw him .
and i &apos;m going to keep playing with na@@ than@@ iel , whether wal@@ t dis@@ ney is a hall or sc@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me of why i became a musi@@ cian .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gu@@ pt@@ a .
robert gu@@ pt@@ a : i want to play something that i &apos;ve unfortunately stol@@ en the c@@ elli@@ st .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
that first one , that was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
it was a beautiful fish , ta@@ sti@@ er , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , rich , poll@@ in@@ ator on the men@@ u .
what a fish .
even better , it was grown in a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture after the most pre@@ cise standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day the head of the company called and asked if i could do this at an event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem became for our coo@@ ks . how do we keep fish on our men@@ u ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the ocean as we &apos;ve be@@ aten for@@ ests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ rate the destru@@ ction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tun@@ as , the heal@@ ing bu@@ tt , the s@@ mil@@ ing , heavy fish , they have collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably or l@@ ush a@@ qu@@ ul@@ ture , fish chan@@ ces , will be part of our future .
many argu@@ ments against it . fis@@ her@@ men poll@@ ute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , we take tun@@ a . a big dis@@ advantage .
he &apos;s got a sc@@ ore from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild@@ fish are necessary to get a po@@ und of sugar tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of public work for the company .
don &apos;t call him .
don , i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollu@@ t the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distribu@@ ted by our fish , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world of ourselves .
this for@@ age from 2.@@ 5 to 1 , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and that night i was lying in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i tele@@ phones with a few people in the company , and nobody could give me a pro@@ per answer , until i finally started with the led biolog@@ ist tele@@ phones .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fish me@@ als , and then he said , chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ our , re@@ fin@@ ed , dri@@ ed and for@@ ged . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much of your food is chicken ? &quot;
in thinking of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about having chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em and good person .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually fell in love with this fish because i swe@@ ar to god who ta@@ sted fish after this conversation after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way in which the better you know your fish , the more you love the fish .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
a friend of journ@@ alists had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it kind of wired us up .
he came to the table with a bright , almost imm@@ une white color .
the chef coo@@ ked it .
hold twice .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious .
who can make a fish taste so well after it &apos;s been coo@@ ked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , it &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fish ris@@ ing in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s near the co@@ in of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
they were growing meat cat@@ tle on what was basically wet@@ lands .
they did that by de@@ wat@@ ering the country .
they built this complicated series of chan@@ n@@ els , and they ur@@ ged water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make the difference , not economic .
and ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds about what many birds are for this place .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with environmental consciousness bought the country .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve rever@@ sed the flow of water .
they &apos;ve literally trans@@ formed the le@@ ver .
instead of pus@@ hing the water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to re@@ move the water .
they fle@@ w the can@@ als .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 he@@ ct@@ ar@@ es of fish -- bar@@ k , sea bran@@ ches , gar@@ n@@ els , a@@ al -- and mi@@ gu@@ el and his company completely rever@@ sed ecolo@@ gical destru@@ ction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen this before .
they st@@ are out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are cur@@ ved chan@@ n@@ els and those den@@ sity , l@@ ush mar@@ ch .
i wasn &apos;t there very long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le for k@@ is@@ sing . &quot;
okay ? we were there , and we f@@ ought through the wet@@ lands , and i &apos;m be@@ ating and swe@@ ating , and i have ma@@ ts@@ ch to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el is going to rest a biology le@@ cture .
here he is high@@ ligh@@ ting a rare ra@@ il@@ way .
now he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on .
and here , he sees a pattern of b@@ und@@ les remin@@ ding him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out mi@@ gu@@ el has spent most of his career in mik@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a fish exper@@ t .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more r@@ ar@@ ely birds and al@@ ga@@ e and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , like that .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became we@@ ak about this coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had in the ev@@ ening .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted it . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how is your fish so good ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
what &apos;s the use of food ? &quot;
well , he continu@@ es to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , that &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ en@@ during .
there &apos;s no food .
the farm your animals don &apos;t feed ?
later that day , i was driving around on this site with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a film dire@@ ctor was dem@@ and@@ ing a change in time .
and we b@@ ent around the corner , and we had the most incredible look at it , thousands and thousands of pin@@ kers fl@@ am@@ in@@ go , literally a pin@@ ker car@@ pet so far .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your sto@@ mach , p@@ ink .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
bad ? i was completely conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you b@@ low your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds .
well , last year , on this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , were over 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private a@@ vi@@ ation reser@@ va@@ tions across europe today .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a well-@@ d@@ ei@@ ved bird not the last thing you want to do on a fish ? &quot;
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re growing exist@@ enti@@ al , not inten@@ sely .
this is an ecolo@@ gical network .
the fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp e@@ ats the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on .
so the more p@@ ink the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s re@@ think that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals and a farm that meas@@ ures their success in the health of their predat@@ ors .
a fish ris@@ ing , but also a bird reser@@ ve .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they bre@@ ed in a city of 2,000 miles away , where the ground quality is better for nest ma@@ inten@@ ance .
every morning they fly 2,000 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly back 2,000 miles .
they do that because they can follow the pain@@ ted white line on the street a@@ 9@@ 2 .
seriously .
i had imag@@ ined a kind of trip to the penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , are you flying 400 miles to the farm and then flying back to the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me like i &apos;d just quot@@ ed a song by wh@@ it@@ ney hou@@ ston .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish that was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it clean . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this sc@@ ary , coo@@ ked taste .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t look at fish skin at all .
she ta@@ sted swe@@ et and pure as if you were to take a bi@@ te off the ocean .
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he was no@@ d@@ ding .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before something comes into the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to un@@ certain@@ ty . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our water has no un@@ its . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success at the success of their predat@@ ors .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have any un@@ certain@@ ty , he under@@ goes tremendous because the water that flo@@ ws through this farm comes from the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are happening now tend to lead them , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , ab@@ und@@ ance of p@@ est control .
and when it &apos;s f@@ ought through the system , and this leaves the water clean than how it came from .
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
so not only a farm that fe@@ e@@ ds its animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures their success in the health of their predat@@ ors , but a farm that literally is a water treatment plant , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water flo@@ ws out , it goes down in the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as roman@@ tic as it is , is also recor@@ ding .
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future for good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bar@@ k or meat cat@@ tle .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one where food actually ta@@ stes good .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , we enjoy . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love wee@@ k@@ markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat bi@@ o .
and if you say that these are the things that in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the future of good food somewhere , someone stands up and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pin@@ ke fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re already producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just .
a billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of kr@@ as@@ ser ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribution , not over@@ all production .
well , i don &apos;t like that question , because she has determin@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system over the last 50 years .
feet of cro@@ ps on her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , p@@ est ir@@ ri@@ gation tools for mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and the whole time the agri@@ business simply as@@ ks , &quot; if we feed more people che@@ aper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was justi@@ fication . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what they are , a commercial in involved , a commercial that e@@ ats rapi@@ dly ecolo@@ gical capital that en@@ ables that production .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cor@@ n@@ cham@@ ber is now thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed not by de@@ gra@@ ding , but by de@@ gra@@ ding resources .
not the lat@@ est stress and tra@@ ctor inven@@ tions , but through ferti@@ le land , not through pump@@ s , but through fresh water , not through cha@@ in@@ saw , but through for@@ ests , and not fishing bo@@ ats and networks , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in there , and it &apos;s never really producing good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecolo@@ gical model .
that &apos;s what comes back to two billion years of labor experience .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that are not only worl@@ ds for themselves to re@@ store rather than using them , oper@@ ations that grow exist@@ enti@@ al , farmers that are not only gener@@ ators , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i ever will be .
you know , that &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
thank you .
if i want to close one thing to you today , it &apos;s that the total amount of data we consu@@ me has gotten bigger than the sum of its parts and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , i want you to think about how we can use information to be so that patterns and so we don &apos;t recognize trends .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical mortality diagra@@ m of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is filter after a certain cause of death , let &apos;s say acci@@ dents .
and immediately i see another pattern that comes out .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of this , people are the most active , and they &apos;re most calcul@@ ated over here .
we can step further out and re@@ ar@@ range the data and see that cir@@ cular disease and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everybody .
now , as we move on and sort of age , we say 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see acci@@ dents are even the main cause for people to worry about .
and who@@ ever sees it , it &apos;s particularly true for men .
so you realize that looking at information and data in this way re@@ minds very much of swi@@ mming in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not content itself ?
so what we have here are the front pictures of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ stro@@ ke that have ever been prin@@ ted .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in your room .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can di@@ ve into a decade .
you can di@@ ve into one particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now when i look here , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this en@@ core and the spor@@ ts species .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i click on this and show all the expen@@ ses that lan@@ ce arm@@ strong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a bigger over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything about bi@@ cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
so i go one step back and i get the view .
now i see gre@@ g le@@ moon .
and so you get an idea that if you go through this kind of information , tar@@ ge@@ ted , bro@@ a@@ der , zo@@ om in , zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just search or sur@@ f .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little bit further with something like what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we did here is we took every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ as@@ er and we redu@@ ced it to a little sum@@ mary .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a short over@@ view and a symbol of the area where it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ as@@ ites .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of &quot; government . &quot;
now , after i cho@@ se government , i know that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ac@@ at@@ ories that are the most co@@ vering time magazine &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a reali@@ zation that &apos;s not in a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ as@@ te .
that &apos;s only to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
looking at one particular of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , then i can go into the theme of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everybody together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government offi@@ ci@@ als . some come from science . some , some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss . and one comes from the music .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
so we can now jump and look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
you see , we sur@@ f on the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but a lot more abstra@@ ct .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this appli@@ cation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at web@@ sites with it -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
so i can step back and jump right to a specific se@@ ction .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because you can only look at web@@ sites in this way , the whole internet course in the same way .
so i can zo@@ om in on my tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory in a certain time .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demon@@ stration i &apos;ve given to this .
and i can sort of repe@@ at anything i &apos;ve seen today .
and , if i go out and look at everything again , i may re@@ ar@@ range my path to my search past . here , i looked for &apos; ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic &apos; here for bing , or here for live lab@@ s .
and from here , i can go into the site and re@@ call them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the whole picture bigger than the sum of the data .
right now , in this world , we think data is a cur@@ se .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about dro@@ w@@ ning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around and turn the internet up@@ side down so that instead of always going from one to another , we can start to go from many things , and see what kind of hidden patterns would have otherwise rema@@ ined ?
if we can do that , this sort of data tra@@ p that &apos;s going to become a new source of meaning@@ ful information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can even pull gra@@ in from it .
i &apos;ll stop with that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a hearing por@@ tion of science fi@@ ction .
in my school time , i went to school on the bus , an hour per day .
and my nose was always in a book , a sci@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ fi@@ ction book that satis@@ fied my thoughts in other worl@@ ds , and in a narra@@ tive , my deep in my se@@ ats , in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able curi@@ osity .
and this curi@@ osity also showed that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , through the for@@ ests , i would wan@@ der and ga@@ ther sam@@ ples and fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and flu@@ ids and d@@ ough water all home watching under the micro@@ scope .
i was totally science enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and explore the limit@@ s of possible .
and my love of science fi@@ ction seemed to res@@ ist in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon and explor@@ ed the deep sea .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never have imag@@ ined before .
i think that &apos;s been very good at this science fi@@ ction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was nei@@ ther video games nor this over@@ se@@ ation of computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated films or the entire media landscape ima@@ gery , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book as children , we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ or and tried it on the screen in our heads .
my reaction to this was to draw and paint from ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps and all that kind of thing .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , like me , hi@@ ding behind the text@@ book , painting around .
creativity somehow had to go out .
and something interesting happened , because what fascin@@ ated me about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au &apos;s shows was the idea of a totally un@@ known world here on earth itself .
i certainly would never reach an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , which seemed pretty un@@ likely to me .
but here was a world i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as all the things i had always imag@@ ined when i had read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , to be a di@@ ver .
the only problem with this is that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand kilometers away from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let myself dis@@ coura@@ ge about that .
i bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , until he finally ex@@ ited a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
i made my sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble in a po@@ ol of the y@@ m@@ ca in the middle of the winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later on to face when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years that have been fail@@ ing now , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , 500 hours of that in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as rich as fascinating life as we can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination does not know bor@@ ders , unlike our own , clear human imagination .
to this day i feel deep a@@ we for what i see on my di@@ ves .
and my love for ocean kee@@ ps , with the same inten@@ sity as e@@ h and ever .
so when i went out as an adult , it was a film@@ making .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner ur@@ ge to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i kept drawing com@@ ic books and stuff .
so movies were the way to bring together pictures and stories . the fit together .
of course , the stories i cho@@ se were the sci@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ fi@@ ction field : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was able to connect my pre@@ ference to the under@@ water world and di@@ ving to the film@@ making .
so basically my two passi@@ ons were inter@@ t@@ win@@ ing .
something interesting happened at ab@@ y@@ ss : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this movie -- and that is , we had to create a kind of liquid water cre@@ ature -- we went on computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g , back .
and what came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated software sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ figure ever to see in a movie .
now , the film didn &apos;t bring in any money , in fact , it just played out its cost of production , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic that ran out of it .
ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , fam@@ ously , is no longer to dist@@ ingu@@ ish advanced technology and magic .
so they saw something ma@@ gical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , this has to be involved in film art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with il@@ m , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success depen@@ ded on how this effect would arri@@ ve .
and it worked . again , we had created something ma@@ gical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played a little bit more money with the film .
of those two experiences , a whole new world was achie@@ ved , a whole new world of creativity for film@@ making .
so i started a company with my good friend stan win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ up and cre@@ at@@ u@@ re-@@ designer at that time called digital do@@ main .
the basic idea of this company was to ski@@ p the phase analo@@ g processes with op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and start with digital produ@@ ctions .
we did that , and we created a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but in the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s , we realized that we were starting in cre@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ - and fan@@ cy design -- which we actually started the company , too slowly .
i had written this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was the measu@@ re@@ ments of visual effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects all over new hei@@ ghts with reali@@ stic human , expres@@ sive characters made by c@@ g , and the main fig@@ ures should all be c@@ g and the world .
but the kni@@ fe pole hit quite ni@@ c@@ ely , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet able to do that .
so i shif@@ ted that and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship . &quot; it became a love film of ep@@ an ex@@ tent , a passionate movie .
but secret , i really wanted to go down to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convin@@ ced you by saying , &quot; we &apos;re di@@ ving to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re fil@@ ming the real w@@ re@@ ck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good sal@@ es@@ man for marketing . &quot;
and i per@@ su@@ aded them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but this comes back to the fact that your imagination can make a reality .
we then actually created a reality six months later in which i found myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll@@ -@@ eye .
this was not a movie , no h@@ d , this was real .
so that ble@@ w me up .
and the prepar@@ ation for that was enormous . we had to build camer@@ as and head@@ lights and all kinds of things .
and i realized how much these deep sea di@@ stances looked like a space mission .
well , they were also highly technical and dur@@ able .
you get into this cap@@ su@@ le , you flo@@ at down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope for res@@ cu@@ e if you don &apos;t go back yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like i &apos;m in a science fi@@ ction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obs@@ essed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , the part that has to do with curi@@ osity and science was everything . it was ad@@ venture , it was curi@@ osity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature where we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
in some of the following expedi@@ tions , i saw creatures in ther@@ mal v@@ ents , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for science at the time when we saw it , there had no words yet .
so i was really blo@@ wn away , and i wanted more .
and so i then made a little unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a film@@ maker in hollywood on ice and i &apos;m going to do ful@@ l-@@ time researchers for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we went to the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and we explor@@ ed them with robo@@ tic experiences .
we re@@ turned to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
we took little robots that we built that wra@@ pped up a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
our purpose was to di@@ ve in and look inside the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explor@@ ed the inside of the w@@ re@@ ck . you didn &apos;t have any means for it . so we developed the technology that you need .
now , i &apos;m sitting on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and i &apos;m looking at plan@@ ks that are pretty similar to these bra@@ kes here , and i know once played the band there .
and i fly with a little robo@@ tic experience through the hall@@ way of the ship .
i &apos;m actually just pra@@ ying it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally in the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
this was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ é@@ j@@ an y@@ elling v@@ u i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i dri@@ ll around a corner at each time , i always knew what was about to appear in the light c@@ one of the vehicle because i was walking through the movie set for months .
the set was actually an accu@@ rate copy of the blu@@ e@@ print of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this tele@@ pres@@ ence experience that you can use robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars like this , and so your consciousness can put into your vehicle into this other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore or do other things in all sorts of post-@@ human@@ -@@ to-@@ future scen@@ ari@@ os that i can think of as a science fi@@ ction fan .
after these expedi@@ tions , we started to really appreci@@ ate what we saw down there , for example , these deep sources where we saw these incredibly amazing animals -- these are sort of ali@@ ens , but here on earth .
they live with the help of chemo@@ syn@@ thesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a solar light system like we do .
and so you see animals right next to 500 degrees cel@@ si@@ us saying they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was the sci@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ fi@@ ction impact from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who have to do with nasa and sit in the nasa exper@@ t commit@@ ment and plan real space mis@@ sions . they go to russi@@ a , they go through the mission to the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s and they take the international space station .
that was fascinating .
but in the end , it turned out that i took space scientists with us to the deep sea .
i took them with me and she@@ ep them access to the world at the bottom : astro@@ biolo@@ gists , planet@@ ary scientists , people interested in those extreme situations , and i took them to the sources for them to look around and test instru@@ ments and so on .
now we did docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but actually done science , in particular , space science .
so the circle between my existence as a science fi@@ ction fan , then as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation to reality .
in the course of this vo@@ y@@ age of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you must now think a dire@@ ctor must also lead , be a leader like a ship cap@@ tain or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i jo@@ ined these expedi@@ tions .
because at a certain point , i had to say to myself , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of that ? &quot;
these sil@@ ly movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of production . don &apos;t go from f@@ ame .
everybody thinks i &apos;d gone off between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; and i &apos;d been cele@@ br@@ ating somewhere on a to@@ we@@ l on the beach .
i made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films for a very small audience .
no f@@ ame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you do it by the task of will , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment that you do . you make it the disco@@ ver@@ able way , and because of the weird connection that comes from a small group of people forming a team .
because we did all this with just 10 to 12 people who worked un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing to do is to take care of one another , because you &apos;ve cop@@ i@@ ed a task that you can &apos;t explain to another .
if you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound we@@ ak@@ ness , and all the technology around it , and all the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human capacity , if you &apos;re working in the lake , you can &apos;t explain it . it &apos;s like the poli@@ ce@@ men , it &apos;s never done .
there &apos;s a connection , a mu@@ tual respect .
so when i came back to make my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to use the same type of leadership , which is that you respect your team and you deser@@ ve on the contr@@ ary of that respect .
this really changed the dynamic .
so i stood there with a small team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new techni@@ que that had not been there before .
incredibly exciting .
a massive challenge .
and we became a real family for four and a half years .
it completely changed my way of making films .
there were people who thought we &apos;d really done these ocean creatures well and transpor@@ ted them on the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a .
for me , it was a principle of doing my job , the actual process that changed .
so what can we conclu@@ de from all this ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think first of all , curi@@ osity is curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human tra@@ it .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and your team &apos;s attention is more important than any l@@ or@@ be@@ er in the world .
i get young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me a ad@@ vice of how to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restri@@ ct yourself .
get others to you . don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself . take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and in explor@@ ing , failure must be an alternative , because it guar@@ an@@ te@@ es that tru@@ sted .
no major en@@ dea@@ vor that requi@@ red innovation was ever approach@@ ed without risk .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to leave you with . fail@@ ures is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my ful@@ l-@@ time job at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ ed , to make the things we have to inv@@ ent and deliver to allow the poor@@ est 2 billion to live better .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than anyone on the planet .
climate change de@@ gra@@ dation means that the speak@@ ers will not grow over many years . it will rain too much or too little . things will change the way that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment cannot main@@ tain .
this leads to star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ rest .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and then the energy ep@@ iso@@ de for them is very important .
in fact , if you could only reduce price by one thing , the poverty redu@@ ction would be the most effective energy .
well , the energy ep@@ iso@@ de has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advan@@ ces .
coal evolution pus@@ hed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case in electricity , and so we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , climate plants , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce price -- let &apos;s hal@@ ve the price -- we hit a new bar@@ rier , and that bar@@ rier is related to co2 .
co2 war@@ ms the planet and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they consu@@ me the stol@@ en co2 that leads to temperature , and that increase in temperature has some very negative effects . effects on weather and perhaps worse , indi@@ re@@ ct that the natural eco@@ systems cannot ada@@ pt so rapi@@ dly to change and therefore whole systems collap@@ se .
well , the ex@@ act relationship between a co2 rise and the results of temperature change and where the other consequences are , there are some ambi@@ gu@@ ity , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambi@@ gu@@ ity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a quar@@ ter enough ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will go up .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying we have a 3@@ .@@ 5 foot high tru@@ ck that needs to be under a three-@@ foot bridge , and then you can kind of squ@@ ee@@ ze it underneath .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we rele@@ ase a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american people about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that will reduce that to zero .
it &apos;s up const@@ ant .
only different economic changes have affected it at all , and we need to go from ra@@ pid to increase and reduce to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that will dep@@ end on the number of people that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service and carbon per unit that &apos;s em@@ it@@ ted .
so let &apos;s look at every factor and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
now this is basic al@@ ge@@ bra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s head@@ ing towards nine billion , moving to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 to 15 percent , but right now we see a slo@@ pe for 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this inclu@@ des all the food we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
these are very good things and poverty redu@@ ction means making these services available to almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we could probably stri@@ ke and use less , but on average , that number will rise every year and therefore double more than dou@@ bt , the number of services that are being provi@@ ded per person .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so that you can read the home@@ work ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their school problems under the streets .
well , in efficiency , the e that makes energy per service , there &apos;s good news finally .
we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
because of different success@@ es in the light sector , through other au@@ tot@@ yp@@ es , through new ways of building buildings , there are many services that make some individual services reduce by 90 percent .
in other services , like ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- &amp; lt ; 00 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air transport or air transport , the play@@ space for impro@@ vement is much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we might get a redu@@ ction by a factor three or maybe even by a factor of six .
but for the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is em@@ it@@ ted per unit of energy .
it &apos;s asking if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufac@@ turing method for electricity today em@@ it@@ ts co2 , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do at a global level is create a new system .
we need energy mira@@ cles .
now when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cles , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the computer is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and its service is a mira@@ cle .
people here contribu@@ ted to the development of many of these mira@@ cles .
usually there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to have a particular date .
usually you &apos;re kind of wrong , and some are not .
but in this case , we have to give full gas and get a mira@@ cle in very short time .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how can i really get this over ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that spar@@ ks the idea of people here ?
i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people liked that .
the idea became really tan@@ gi@@ ble for them , you know that there are people living with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es .
for energy , this came to mind .
i decided that the un@@ le@@ as@@ hing of fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment this year .
so here &apos;s some natural fire@@ flies .
i was told they &apos;re not going to bi@@ te . they &apos;re not going to even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of g@@ ad@@ gets like this , but they don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able sc@@ aling and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and although there are many ways in which people are looking for it , i really only see five that can afford these big dem@@ ands .
i &apos;ve left out time , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
this one may contribu@@ te a modern contribu@@ tion , and if you pay better than i expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up on them because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fu@@ els , burning coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems to be easy , but it &apos;s not easy . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of the ch@@ im@@ ney , catch , flow under pressure , and then store somewhere , hop@@ ing it sta@@ ys there .
there are some pilot projects that can do this at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but getting it to 100 percent is going to be very difficult . and getting an agre@@ ement for stor@@ ing co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the lon@@ ger@@ -@@ time question .
who will make it safe ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee what literally billions of times larger than any kind of g@@ arb@@ age you can imagine of nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
so this is a tough n@@ uss .
next , nuclear power .
they also have three big problems . the cost , especially in high-@@ reg@@ ul@@ ated countries . the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite human co@@ operation , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so three very difficult problems that might be sol@@ vable , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
i sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed the last three of the five .
it &apos;s rene@@ w@@ ables as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
one is the energy den@@ sity that these technologies create dra@@ matically lower than the power plant .
these are energy ves@@ sel@@ s , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , thousands of times more land than a normal power station .
also , these sources under@@ lie inter@@ rup@@ tions .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and the same is not constantly blo@@ wing the wind .
that &apos;s why , if you dep@@ end on these sources , you have a way to get the energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there are big pri@@ ces here . there are challenges in trans@@ mission , for example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also need to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the charge problem .
and to show the dimension , i looked at all the kinds of bat@@ teri@@ es that are produced , looking at : the cars , the computers , cell phones , po@@ cket li@@ ps , everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got with the amount of electr@@ onic energy that the world uses , compared to the size of bat@@ teri@@ es that we &apos;re going to produce less than 10 minutes .
so what we need here is a big break@@ through , something that is going to be 100 times better than the approach@@ es that we have right now .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these inter@@ rup@@ ted sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumer .
if you want to support yourself by 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery .
now , where should we go ? what &apos;s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get there ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
they &apos;ll say in many , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think there are many here at the ted group who are already involved there .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other things called es@@ ol@@ ar , who have great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ death k@@ ho@@ sl@@ a invest@@ es in do@@ zens of companies who do great things and have interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i fin@@ ance a company that , maybe surpris@@ ingly , tra@@ cks the nuclear approach .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear field ; mod@@ ular , liquid .
development stopped some time ago in this industry , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concep@@ ts are lying around .
the ter@@ ra@@ power@@ -@@ concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ ani@@ um , one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to reas@@ on@@ ably simu@@ late whether it worked , but since there &apos;s modern super@@ computer , you can simu@@ late it and see that , yes , with the right materi@@ ali@@ zing approach , it looks like this .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost profi@@ le is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors as pro@@ pul@@ sions .
instead of brea@@ king your head on it , you just burn it . great thing .
the ur@@ ani@@ um is used gradu@@ ally , a bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of colum@@ n , often known as the pas@@ sing wave of re@@ actor .
it really sol@@ ves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
this is the waste that &apos;s 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s called a u@@ tili@@ ty ur@@ ani@@ um .
the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you take oce@@ an@@ ic water and you just filter it , you get enough fuel for the rest of the lifetime of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should our te@@ stim@@ ony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the inter@@ medi@@ ate step .
many talk about 80 percent redu@@ ction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and there &apos;s still some agriculture , and hopefully wh@@ ale threat and c@@ ement will be clean up until then .
so in order to reach these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , have to completely re@@ frame their electricity generation .
the other note is whether we &apos;re using zero emis@@ sions of technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this becomes a key element of this te@@ stim@@ ony .
if we go back from there , what should that look like in 20@@ 20 ?
it should again con@@ tain the two elements .
we should use the efficiency meas@@ ures to get redu@@ ction . the less we em@@ it@@ ate , the less the carbon sum will be , and therefore the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we do not lead to all the big redu@@ ctions , just the same , or even less important to the others , which is the speed of innovation for these break@@ through@@ s .
these break@@ through@@ s we have to pur@@ sue full gas , and we can measure that in corpo@@ rate numbers , in pil@@ ot@@ ing projects and regu@@ lation changes .
there are many great books on this top@@ ic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys &quot; po@@ ol energy for the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a fra@@ me@@ work where this can be discus@@ sed in , because we need support from all sides .
there are some things that need to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very con@@ cre@@ te desire for us to inv@@ ent this technology .
if you only give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is hal@@ f-@@ energy ep@@ iso@@ de without co2 , i will take that wish .
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the bu@@ ried between the long-term and the shor@@ t-@@ term people will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of those 2 billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what meas@@ ures do i appe@@ al to ?
we need to apply ourselves to more research money .
when countries meet like cop@@ enha@@ gen in places , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation strategy , and they would be s@@ mil@@ ed by the s@@ mil@@ ing ones spent on these innovative approach@@ es .
we need market in@@ centi@@ ves , carbon ta@@ xes , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a price signal .
we have to spread the message .
we need to have dialo@@ gue rational and complete and also the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ power a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , get all the big scientists to do what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million . and even if we test our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
the hard step is building the first re@@ actor to find another billion , the reg@@ ul@@ ari@@ ans and the place that actually makes the first one .
once the first one is done , when it &apos;s going to be as promis@@ ed , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy den@@ sity , is as different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to get that right , that means building deep into the ground , almost like a ver@@ tical colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , this consum@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts to build up , and continu@@ es to work down ?
b@@ g : yeah . today you have to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the re@@ actor all the time , so there are lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and bring stuff in or out . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- they &apos;re bu@@ ried without all the complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear re@@ actor that off@@ ers a solution to waste itself .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens to the g@@ arb@@ age : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- take it and put it in the next re@@ actor and burn it on .
and we start by taking the g@@ arb@@ age that already exists , which is in these re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or dry tan@@ ks in the re@@ ac@@ tors . that &apos;s our start fuel .
so what a problem with these re@@ ac@@ tors is what we fill in our fil@@ ling and is dra@@ matically redu@@ ced the volu@@ me of waste during this process .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where &apos;s the most interesting thing to do ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t yet set up a place , and there are a lot of interesting rules of open@@ ness for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear . &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company in russi@@ a , india , i &apos;ve been here and i &apos;ve met the energy agenda and i &apos;ve talked about how energy agenda has been .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a vari@@ ant of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor and some countries built it , so anybody who has done a fast re@@ actor is a can@@ di@@ date for our first .
in your imagination , time frame and prob@@ ability to really bring this into life ?
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , ex@@ ecu@@ tive things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to use .
this is like the de@@ ad@@ line that has given us the environmental models that we have to stop .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if everything is fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy to hold .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , today there are do@@ zens of companies , and we need hundreds that , in the same way , when their approach@@ es work , can offer to their pil@@ ots .
and it would be best if you did it multiple , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
anyway , we need a solution .
given the great possible break@@ through@@ s , is this the greatest thing you know ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
it would have been without environmental requi@@ re@@ ment , but it would have been so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s a mod@@ ular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor type that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is that a ur@@ ani@@ um molecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s why if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the foot@@ print and costs , the potential , almost the other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to introduce emergen@@ cy services to try to main@@ tain the temperature stable ?
b@@ g : when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve e@@ aten too much , and just before you get a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research direction called geo@@ engineering that add@@ res@@ ses various techniques to del@@ ay warming so that we can get 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work at all on in@@ sur@@ ance , because it might make you la@@ zy , so you keep eating because you know you &apos;re going to save your heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re leading to this problem , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course in geo@@ engineering about whether you should have that if things are coming faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
climate mas@@ ke@@ p@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for those to maybe convince you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics are living in very different cam@@ ps .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is a bit like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pres@@ sing problems of invest@@ ing in something that you only have later on -- and the investment is not so clear . in fact , i@@ p@@ c@@ c report is not necessarily the worst scen@@ ario and there &apos;s no people in the world , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s not a big thing .
the fact is that this un@@ certain@@ ty should make us worried .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time re@@ move the co2 , the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t em@@ it@@ ate co2 , i almost wish it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it as the previ@@ ous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the b@@ j@@ local l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suff@@ er , redu@@ cing poverty , fighting malaria and so on , there &apos;s a better waste of resources .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
there are other things that shouldn &apos;t suff@@ er .
you come to large su@@ ms , and here , sensi@@ ble people can dis@@ agree if you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to fund that . for me , most of the waste is happening here .
except , you &apos;re very short before a break@@ through , and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much che@@ aper .
if the stri@@ ke you get is a very high energy ep@@ iso@@ de , then the rich ones can only keep up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifest@@ yle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks about it .
his new magic is now , &quot; why is research not going to talk about anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still associated with the skep@@ tic@@ ist camp , but he understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group , and so he &apos;s now making the research argument .
and this is a min@@ d@@ set that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s being suppor@@ ted .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all the people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
b@@ g : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four@@ -@@ foot teams have to build the largest possible structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ h@@ ett@@ i , about 1@@ -@@ foot tape , about three meters of thre@@ ad and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low needs to be on top .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it pus@@ hes people very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops worldwide with students and develop@@ ers and archite@@ cts , even c@@ to@@ s of fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ company , and there &apos;s something about this task that en@@ ables deep inter@@ faces to work with them , and i want to share with you some of them .
usually most people start ori@@ enting themselves on the task .
they talk about what it will look like , they run around power .
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and you sk@@ et@@ ch and you lay out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ ett@@ i .
they spend a lot of their time building this growing structure all the time .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and you put it g@@ ently at the top , step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; ! ad@@ mi@@ re your work .
but what happens , almost all the time , is that the ta@@ -@@ da becomes an u@@ h-@@ oh , because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the whole thing to b@@ end and fall as@@ le@@ ep .
there are a number of people who have much more u@@ h-@@ oh moments than others , and under the worst of them are fresh b@@ w@@ l gradu@@ ates .
they lie , they che@@ at , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they make really poor shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have much more ta@@ -@@ da shapes , and under the best of which there are fresh students in kinder@@ garten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , not only do they produce the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , why is this ? why ? what about them ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend time being the head of the sp@@ ag@@ h@@ ett@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t spend time in power fi@@ ghts .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that b@@ w@@ l students were trained to find the right plan , ok .
and then realize him .
what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children &apos;s gar@@ den@@ ing kids do differently is they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have multiple times the ability to re@@ pair color@@ ed prototyp@@ es .
construction players recognize this kind of collabor@@ ation as the core of an i@@ ter@@ ative process .
and with each trial , children get inst@@ ant feedback , which works and which doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance of working with prototyp@@ es is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of them is about 50 in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students get half of them , law@@ yers get a little bit more , but not much , kinder@@ garten children are better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
archite@@ cts and engineers , fortunately .
one foot is the highest i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and make sure self-@@ am@@ pli@@ fying geomet@@ ri@@ c patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ce@@ os are a little bit about average . but here it gets interesting .
if you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , they &apos;re signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that happening ?
because they have special skills of process@@ ing .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team that reg@@ ul@@ ates and attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the performance of the team .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ing skills and their combin@@ ation lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that go typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
now i tried something interesting .
i thought , well let &apos;s take the po@@ ker service in a second .
so i off@@ ered a $ 10,000 prize for software for the w@@ inn@@ ers .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two-@@ in@@ ch construction , he would have car@@ ried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ?
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
so from the same bad team , one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are profound lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually invest time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
the reason is to help me create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and visual tricks .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low building .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ b@@ y-@@ step gui@@ dance there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world how people optimi@@ ze and re@@ fine the system .
there are also world recor@@ ds .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a commit@@ ment sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking opti@@ m@@ ally , like our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies ahead .
and sometimes a small prototyp@@ e of this experience is all it takes to take us from an u@@ h-@@ oh -- to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pre@@ tend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve often asked my friends this question , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america is looking for super@@ star . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;ve somehow moved to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to w@@ inn@@ ing thinking .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time ever available on this planet no matter what scale you want : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ lin@@ ing disease .
there has never been a time like this before .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents all died when they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents pus@@ hed that number to 7@@ 0@@ th .
my parents are the 80 on the far side .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
they re@@ formed the earth &apos;s demo@@ graphi@@ cs in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
we forced them . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us have bar@@ ely thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed one generation before .
di@@ ph@@ y , ro@@ tel@@ n , child paraly@@ sis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success of the scientific method .
and in my view , the scientific way to try things is to see if it works , change it if it doesn &apos;t , one of humanity &apos;s greatest achie@@ v@@ ements .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
and one of them is that , despite all our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people in the world go to bed every day .
that number goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to really de@@ va@@ st@@ ate this world .
drin@@ king water , ancient land , rain@@ for@@ ests , oil , gas : they disappe@@ ar soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos inno@@ v@@ ate , we &apos;re also disappe@@ aring .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world that doesn &apos;t break it at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wo@@ und thinking .
but this is what kee@@ ps me a@@ wake at night -- one of the things that kee@@ ps me a@@ wake at night . we never needed scientific progress as ur@@ gent as we are now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to use it reas@@ on@@ ably , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the th@@ res@@ hold to an amazing , amazing event in many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to find a time in which we &apos;ve strug@@ gl@@ ed progress , in which we &apos;ve fu@@ el@@ ed more than we &apos;ve launched .
people are hop@@ ing in their faith , and it &apos;s so close that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will set it free .
and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right to their opini@@ on , even a right to progress .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
they &apos;re not right to their own facts . &apos; sorry , they &apos;re not .
and it took me a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vac@@ cin@@ ations for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little article .
and i was ama@@ zed to find resi@@ stance in resi@@ stance towards what is ultimately the most effective thing in public health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and continued to do .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetic food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ food , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a certain way instead of sho@@ ot@@ ing around an en@@ cro@@ p@@ ha@@ l in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we rich , we walk in , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about these artic@@ les , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found out .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics that made me crazy were not a fan@@ a@@ tic at all .
these were people who were care@@ ful , edu@@ cated people , dur@@ able people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so conf@@ used .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we talk about it in twi@@ n .
we &apos;re talking ir@@ onic about this , with little leadership about &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for this , and i think we know what reasons these are .
we have lost trust in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call it a few names and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ o@@ x , weapons of mass destru@@ ction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction in 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right , so be skep@@ tical .
ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
take nothing for gran@@ ted .
but here it is : if you have to prove that you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that , for the reason , we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that connected autis@@ m epidemic to mas@@ ses , mu@@ mp@@ s , and ro@@ tel@@ n vaccine .
very sc@@ ary .
studies were done to see if that was true .
studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe in what we see , what we believe , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government wor@@ ker that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world to sin@@ k the imm@@ uni@@ zation for mas@@ ses .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened was we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody have mas@@ ses here ?
has a single person in the audience ever seen somebody die of mas@@ ses ?
don &apos;t happen very often .
don &apos;t happen at all in this country , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of dea@@ ths from mas@@ ses , 20 an hour .
but because this didn &apos;t happen here , we can dis@@ place it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and pre@@ ach mes@@ sages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of humanity &apos;s worst minds .
no fear , no tor@@ ture , child paraly@@ sis , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
he &apos;s just developed a ro@@ ta@@ vir@@ us vaccine with a few other people .
he can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , except for paul to walk around and talk about vac@@ cin@@ es and say how valuable they are , and that people should just stop bit@@ ing .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terror@@ ist .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say he can &apos;t say he &apos;s a gun laun@@ dry .
he gets calls home because people like to tell him where his kids are going to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
go on , go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we have mas@@ ses in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of mas@@ ses .
what about child paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a military of mine wrote to me a couple of weeks ago , and she said , &quot; i think i &apos;m a little bit too sh@@ ri@@ ll . &quot;
no one ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child against child paraly@@ sis . absolutely not .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paraly@@ sis . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have child paraly@@ sis yesterday in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in la@@ gos got on an airplane this morning and just fle@@ w to los angeles right now , he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and in a few hours he lands and r@@ ents a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner ton@@ ight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it &apos;s not .
we love to hi@@ p in lies . we love that .
have you all taken your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ cy that helps you le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g .
i know they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
the data is constantly demon@@ str@@ ating it .
they ev@@ apo@@ rate their ur@@ ine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
i totally agree with them .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is mi@@ es .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ishing cold and ridi@@ cul@@ ous to ourselves that can afford it .
so we &apos;re going off , and where are we going ?
we go to the poor of the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
none of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , fr@@ au@@ d , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it ; it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ am at me and say , &quot; what care ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to adop@@ t my experts on mammo@@ graphy , &quot; or any can@@ cer@@ ous j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish trying to treat his patients with ca@@ ff@@ iti .
when they get to that path where belief and magic re@@ place them , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they go to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people because he insi@@ sted that red bee@@ f , bone and le@@ mon oil are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs that we know can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary dea@@ ths in one country that &apos;s worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have it . they always have it .
now , the most brain loo@@ se epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d struggle between the for@@ bi@@ d genetic fo@@ ods and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
this is ide@@ ology , not science .
everything we eat , every ri@@ ce , every bran@@ ch of pe@@ ter@@ sil@@ ence , every ro@@ sen@@ co@@ le , has been changed by the people .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ins in par@@ ad@@ ise .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ i mel@@ ons .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 1,000 years .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can take it closer . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re re@@ je@@ cting genetic food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own see@@ ds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid we &apos;re really dead , and it hol@@ ds millions of people from blo@@ om .
you know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we currently have . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
embar@@ ras@@ sing . embar@@ ras@@ sing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and why ? genetic food changed .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this ro@@ tten stuff like mani@@ ok .
mani@@ ok is something that is eating half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this into it right now .
and then people could eat it and not get blind .
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about pus@@ hing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ ghts on larger food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to be as gu@@ il@@ ty as we have before , i think we want to be inno@@ cent , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s our not wor@@ thy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , they may want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i certainly want that .
it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to go , and we &apos;ll move them where we want to .
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we have to think , but as we go up into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to do that .
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . it may seem od@@ d that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested in it , unless you look at it the way i think of it as , &quot; a de@@ ception that &apos;s going to happen if only somebody belie@@ ves it . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and that &apos;s only because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient belie@@ ves the effect , is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
a de@@ ception becomes something real because someone percei@@ ves it this way .
so in order to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least been in every ma@@ gi@@ cian since the 195@@ 0s .
i learned him from cu@@ b sc@@ out of magic the path@@ fin@@ der in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the kni@@ fe you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the kni@@ fe in my hand like this .
i push my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ ev@@ es or comes out of it , i &apos;m just going to put together my wr@@ ist right there .
that &apos;s how you can see that at no point any time anything moves , as long as i press here , nothing can go to my sle@@ e@@ ve or emer@@ ge .
and the goal here is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is going well , the kni@@ fe is held by my m@@ ere physical magne@@ tis@@ m .
it &apos;s actually so strong in its place that i can shake it without the kni@@ fe fall@@ ing down .
nothing goes to my sle@@ e@@ ve or comes out , no tri@@ ck@@ iness , and you can study everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach little kids to be interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in this room probably know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i say that i inclu@@ de my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing disappe@@ ars or comes out in my sle@@ e@@ ve , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i hold my wr@@ ist is because it &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
because the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from the back , these fing@@ ers here , my finger , just from where it was , to a position where it was so exten@@ ded .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no childhood .
so it &apos;s here . right .
and as i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you can &apos;t see that there are only three fing@@ ers down here : because the mind and the way that he processes information , doesn &apos;t count it , one , two , three , but seeing it as a group .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s held there , but not by the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but by a trick , by my finger , which is there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s hidden by this movement that the fing@@ ers are moving back .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really ble@@ w me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , and so this was an amazing thing for me .
because what it turns out is that if you offer plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , in the form of an as@@ pir@@ in@@ tab@@ let , it &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you pass the shape in which you give plac@@ e@@ bo the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , changes into a smaller p@@ ill , and color@@ ed these blue and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
and that , although none of them are any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? it really fre@@ ak@@ ed me out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all yet .
if you take cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re even more effective than any p@@ ills .
one color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , which is in one end yellow and on the other red , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
the do@@ sage also plays a role .
a p@@ ill twice a day is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the ex@@ act statistics now . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that do@@ ses also matter .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to reach the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an in@@ effective -- a few milli@@ ons of an effective sub@@ stance you in@@ je@@ ct to a patient .
this creates a very strong image in your mind . this is much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time we have a proje@@ ctor .
so in fact , the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t work as the need@@ le .
and none of it has any really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property , and it &apos;s just our belief in it that makes us more powerful .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something which is obviously de@@ ception , and let it look real .
we know from that study that you have to reach the need@@ le if you want to go to the point .
this is an ei@@ ght-@@ in@@ ch long hu@@ t@@ need@@ le . it &apos;s very , very pe@@ a@@ ks , and i &apos;m going to steri@@ li@@ ze it a little bit first .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . it &apos;s not dam@@ i@@ ans &apos; especially cul@@ tured meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this need@@ le into my skin and drive it through the other side , until it re@@ stri@@ kes .
if you get l@@ us@@ hed -- if you fall easy in the chicken -- i introduced this to a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly grew wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad .
so i &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re going to quickly get evil , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to do the first heal@@ ing part here in the back .
you can see it in a second , but you can see it away if you want .
so , it goes like this , right here where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little ent@@ ry .
i &apos;m really sorry . is this crazy ?
and just now , a little bit through my skin and on the other side , like that .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had when we had a kni@@ fe trick .
something like this .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid , and it &apos;s self-@@ pen@@ et@@ r@@ ating , just to give us a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay , i didn &apos;t really see it . &quot;
people in the side rooms come in now .
let me show it from near .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can turn it around .
sorry . if you get evil , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people in the back or the people who see this later on on , will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty im@@ pres@@ sive , but if it &apos;s real , he would -- look here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really was , it would ble@@ ed . &quot;
okay , let me squ@@ ee@@ ze some blood out for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take out the need@@ le now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no les@@ i@@ ons .
but i think , in this fra@@ me@@ work here and inten@@ tion of making something real out of de@@ ception , i &apos;m just going to leave the need@@ le in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;ll see ourselves in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness these days .
i &apos;ve had some people count the number of books that have been published with happiness in the ti@@ tle in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 , and there &apos;s been much more .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in researchers under happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but despite all this flo@@ od of work , there are multiple cognitive tra@@ ins that sort of make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is main@@ ly about these cognitive tra@@ ps .
this is true of la@@ y@@ ered thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess as everyone else .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a resi@@ stance to ad@@ mit complexity .
it turns out the word of happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could nar@@ row it down , but in general , that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to adop@@ t the complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
the second case is a change in experience and memory : it &apos;s basically between happy being in his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both thre@@ w together in the notion of happiness .
and the third one is concent@@ ration illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affe@@ cts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer s@@ ession after one of my le@@ c@@ tures , who repor@@ ted a story . &#91; un@@ clear &#93; he said he heard a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music , and at the end of the sho@@ ot@@ ing sound .
and then he ad@@ ded up , really quite emotion@@ ally , that &apos;s ru@@ ined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t have that .
what it had ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was in love with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and memory was all he had to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present day and knows the present is able to re@@ experience the past , but basically only has the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor pri@@ zes -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hur@@ t now if i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is that coun@@ ting and susta@@ ining the history of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor spea@@ ks to by saying , &quot; how have you felt l@@ ately ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different un@@ its , the living self and memory self , and conf@@ using those two is part of the trans@@ forming concept of happiness .
now , the memor@@ i@@ zing self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
and this really starts with a fundamental response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
not only do we tell stories when we make ourselves tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we must keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients getting in a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into the details . she &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful , but she was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to cover their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are your recor@@ ds .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suff@@ ered from both of them ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the gut refle@@ ction than patient b.
the stories of the mirror were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very construction or great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse was where the pain was at the very end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people about their refle@@ ction , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memor@@ i@@ zing self .
clearly , from the perspective of the living self , b had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually increase the refle@@ ction of the patient a by simply pus@@ hing the tube in without getting too much of it .
that &apos;s going to make the patient suff@@ er , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have caused the living self to be worse off by patient a , and you &apos;ve done that reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing yourself is much better off the patient a , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story of your experience .
what is a story about ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories we have to memory , and it &apos;s true of the stories we inv@@ ent .
what a story represents is out@@ brea@@ ks , major moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end domin@@ ated .
well , living self lives continu@@ ously .
it has moments of life , one by one .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i calcul@@ ated this -- you know , the psycholo@@ gical pres@@ ence is true for about three seconds . which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in one month . there &apos;s about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 of them don &apos;t leave behind .
most of you are completely ignor@@ ed by reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the im@@ pression that you should count that what happened in those moments of life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in the world .
and how we used it to seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that re@@ minds the memory itself .
so we have the memor@@ i@@ zing self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal with time .
from the perspective of the living self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is as good as the first week , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
this doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
for the memory of itself , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is har@@ dly better than the one week vac@@ ation , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a memory of a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing itself is doing more than reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , had two refle@@ ctions of two different surge@@ ons and deci@@ des which to choose , then the one who choo@@ ses the memory that &apos;s less bad and that &apos;s the surge@@ on .
the living self has no voice in that choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as predi@@ cted memor@@ ies .
and basically , you can think of this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the memory self , and you can think of the memory itself as one that kind of dra@@ ins the living self through experiences that the living self does not need .
i have the im@@ pression that if we do vac@@ ation , it &apos;s very often the case , which means we make vac@@ ation lar@@ gely in the service of memory itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me from our memor@@ ies ?
this is one of the explan@@ ations given to the domin@@ ance of the memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we did a few years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often about how often i think about other vac@@ ations .
and i &apos;ve probably consum@@ ed by my memor@@ ies of this three-@@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;d ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures inside , i would have spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s about three and a half hours .
there seems to be an dis@@ agre@@ ement there .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have on the to@@ es of memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memor@@ ies so much weight over the course of the weight that we give experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know , at the end of the vac@@ ation , all your images are being destro@@ yed , and you get an am@@ nes@@ ian drug so you will remember nothing .
now would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you were to choose another holi@@ day , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you might get an answer . and if you think about a different answer .
why we sele@@ ct the vac@@ ation that we &apos;re looking for is a problem we have with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness up .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you &apos;d ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the earth itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to have a pretty good idea of the happiness of the earth itself over time .
if you ask about the happiness of the memory , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or deli@@ gh@@ ted the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish these terms is going to scre@@ w up the research of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the researchers on well-@@ being that has ra@@ ped happiness in that same way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the living self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the memory itself has been recogni@@ zed in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate ones .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey where over half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other eff@@ or@@ ts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson we learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with your life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice ver@@ sa .
just to give you a sense of cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody and you were to tell them , oh , your father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody has or@@ dered their lives as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with his living self .
so cor@@ relation is low .
we know something about what determin@@ es happiness itself .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly about being satis@@ fied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two types of self , you will end up doing very different things .
the conclu@@ sion of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a re@@ plac@@ ement of well-@@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very brie@@ fly , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we don &apos;t notice the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , do you think the people in california have to be happ@@ ier if they live , say , in o@@ hi@@ o ?
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thou@@ ght@@ ful self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
well , because the memor@@ able self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up pul@@ ling to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people moving to california in hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , your living self will not get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how terrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well-@@ being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we spoke to me a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gall@@ up po@@ ll .
is this something you can participa@@ te in , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left now ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting out@@ come we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ up po@@ ll is a number that we absolutely did not expect .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self .
when we looked at how feelings v@@ ary income .
and it turns out that among a 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a huge repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple among a 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
6@@ 0,000 .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year are people un@@ happy , and they become increasingly less un@@ happy , the poor@@ er they get .
we get an absolutely flat line on that .
i mean , i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously money doesn &apos;t raise an experience happiness , but that lack of money is certainly mis@@ er@@ able , and we can measure it very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , of memory itself , you get a different story .
the more money you make , the happ@@ ier you are .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
but dan@@ ny , in the entire american pur@@ suit , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took this fund seriously , i mean , it all seems to be put on their head , everything we think , in terms of ta@@ x policy and so on .
is there any chance that politicians would generally take a fund like this seriously and make politics based on this ?
d@@ k : you know , i think there &apos;s recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness in politics .
recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
people are recogni@@ zing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will disc@@ uss whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life gra@@ des , so we have to have this discus@@ sion pretty quickly .
how to increase happiness is very different depen@@ ding on how you think and whether you think about the memory itself or whether you think of the living self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the years ahead .
in the united states , you &apos;re strug@@ gling to measure the experience happiness of the population .
that will , i think , be part of the national statistics in the next decade or two .
well , it seems to me that this is going to be , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pur@@ sue over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design computer games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is in online games .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people including all of you to spend more time playing more and more fun games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe too much time if you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , following my research at the institute of the future is just the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pres@@ sing problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to dra@@ matically increase that time .
i calcul@@ ated that the time it took is at 21 billion hours of play a week .
this may seem a little bit rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant first , so i can do it again : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global confli@@ cts and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture pretty much descri@@ bes why i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portra@@ it of photograph@@ er phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to catch the feelings in play , so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classi@@ c expres@@ sions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might miss some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but also ex@@ ternal concent@@ ration , deep into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;re going to see some nu@@ an@@ ces here that are up@@ ward eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws show surprise .
this is a player standing on the edge of what &apos;s called an epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ory .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
one epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ory is a result that &apos;s so super@@ ior in a positive way that you didn &apos;t know it was possible before .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you do it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked to actually be able to do that . that &apos;s an epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ory .
this is a player just before an epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ vers all over the world when we look at the hur@@ d@@ les of the next century , the face of those who are on the edge of an epi@@ c sett@@ le@@ ment .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it &quot; i &apos;m bad &quot; face in life , and it &apos;s actually my face , you know ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me making the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i studied in my ph@@ .@@ d. , why do we do better than in real life ?
that &apos;s a problem a lot of players have .
we think in reality , we &apos;re not as good as we play in .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
we achieve more in game worl@@ ds . i mean good at working with motivation to do something meaning@@ ful , inspired for collabor@@ ation .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turn to our best version , at any given time and immediately are willing to try to solve the problem as long as necessary as we need to try it again after the failure .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel different .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel de@@ fe@@ ated . we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , perhaps depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t do everything ?
how can we trans@@ fer these feelings from games to reality ?
so i looked at games like world of war@@ craft that off@@ ers the ide@@ al environment to collabor@@ ative problem solving .
and i &apos;ve found some things that make the epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ories possible in online worl@@ ds .
so , first of all , when you get into one of these online games , especially world of war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a worl@@ d-@@ tre@@ ating mission , and that is inst@@ antly available .
but not just any mission , but a mission that f@@ its perfect at its current level in the game , right ?
so they do .
they never get a problem they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , so they have to struggle , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are wise employees .
wh@@ er@@ ever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with you to finish your epi@@ c mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in real life , that feeling that there are a finger s@@ wee@@ ping staf@@ f ready .
and there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and pl@@ us-@@ one streng@@ th , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this const@@ ant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have pl@@ us-@@ one talk and + 1 crazy idea , pl@@ us-@@ 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get the feedback in real life .
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worl@@ ds like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to stand on the edge of an epi@@ c sett@@ le@@ ment all the time in these worl@@ ds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
to this day , all the world of war@@ cra@@ f@@ i players spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to up@@ right .
so the first exciting pri@@ mate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend playing right now , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but it also su@@ its . because it turns out that using this whole time to play , we actually change what we can do as humans .
we develop into collabor@@ ative thinking , heart cre@@ ature .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe in .
if you look at this interesting stati@@ stic recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person in a country today sp@@ ends 10,000 hours with strong play culture with online games to the 21@@ st of life .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act over@@ all work they spend in school from grade five to graduate high school -- if you never fail .
so here we have a full parallel education path where young people learn as well , which means to be a good player , like anything else they learn at school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book of mal@@ col@@ m g@@ la@@ d@@ well , &quot; over@@ fly . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os on any subject subject to the 21@@ st year of life , we become ma@@ sters in it .
we become as good at doing whatever the most important people in the world do .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players terri@@ bly good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have almost never been there to provide any human potential before .
so many people we currently have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are remark@@ ably good at something .
and the next decade we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that save energy and work on mobile wir@@ es instead of the broad@@ band internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , can play online .
you &apos;d expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
we have 1.@@ 5 billion players over@@ all .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to master these games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m .
ok , imagine how extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation works .
ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m is the desire to do something immediately , to master a hur@@ d@@ le , along with the belief that we have an green@@ ed hope for success .
players always believe that an epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are ma@@ sters in the spi@@ ders of social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like to play with them , even if they de@@ fe@@ ated us .
the reason for this is because it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody sp@@ ends time with us that the rules will be held , that we have the same goal , and until the game end re@@ main there .
so , playing together allows for conne@@ ctivity to grow , trust and trust .
as a result , we &apos;re building stron@@ ger social relationships .
happy produ@@ ctivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ f@@ i players plays 22 hours a week , sort of as a part@@ -@@ time job .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier to work hard than if we rela@@ x or nothing .
we know that we work opti@@ mal as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
and finally , ep@@ ical meaning .
players love to be part of a@@ we mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary mas@@ ses .
here &apos;s a back@@ bone forma@@ tion to bring that to the right light , and you all know wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki in the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 ent@@ ries , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they put together more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic in every other wi@@ ki in the world .
they create an epi@@ c story .
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
ok , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to one conclu@@ sion . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
these are people who believe that as individuals , they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a local scientist .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to wit@@ ness any less than a mass mi@@ gration in virtual worl@@ ds and online game environ@@ ments . &quot;
and this is from an econom@@ ist . so it &apos;s lo@@ gical .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little bit over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than in real life .
you can make more powerful social ties in games than in real life . you get more feedback and re@@ wards in play than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely lo@@ gical at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s lo@@ gical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ m@@ al situation .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,@@ 500 years .
there are these ancient cu@@ bes made out of she@@ ep . you know ?
before these fantastic game controll@@ ers , there were she@@ ep &apos;s sk@@ ating .
and these were sort of the first of people to have developed to@@ ys .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you may know this story , the story about how and why games were invented .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , games were actually invented cu@@ be games , in the king@@ dom of ly@@ di@@ a during fam@@ ine .
there was such a fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ a decided to make a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the cu@@ be and the united , a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so deep into the cu@@ be , because games are so fascinating and surro@@ unded with satis@@ fying , happy produ@@ ctivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they survi@@ ved that fam@@ ine for 18 years by eating and playing the next day .
li@@ ke@@ wise , i think , we &apos;re setting up games today .
we use games to es@@ cape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get away from everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying in real life , and we get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years , fam@@ ine didn &apos;t get better , so the king decided to set up a final cu@@ be game .
they shared the king@@ dom in two hal@@ ves .
they played a cu@@ be game , and the se@@ vent@@ h got to break up an epi@@ c ad@@ venture .
they were leaving poetry and they were looking for a new home , and they were leaving as many people as there was food to survive , looking for the rest for an area where they could thri@@ ve .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but ne@@ west dna evidence shows that the et@@ russi@@ ans who later formed the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re show the same dna as the old poetry .
so scientists recently came to think that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy story actually is true .
and ge@@ olo@@ gists found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that took almost 20 years to explain fam@@ ine .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe they actually saved their people through play by fli@@ pping into games for 18 years and then having this in@@ environment and learning so much about playing with each other that they were saving the entire civilization .
so , we can do that too .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
this was the world &apos;s first strategy game in real time of war@@ cra@@ f@@ i series . this was 16 years ago .
they played cu@@ be games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion hours a week .
we should in@@ fer that half of us spend an hour playing with games a day until we solved the real world &apos;s problems .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems from the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been doing in the last few years at the institute of the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , expres@@ sing how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible out@@ come , and then people are em@@ power@@ ing to imple@@ ment that idea into reality .
we imagine epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ories and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;ll show you just brie@@ fly three games that i designed to try and create people epi@@ c vi@@ ct@@ ories in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come an oil shor@@ tage .
the oil shor@@ tage is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough online content to make it reali@@ stic for them , and they &apos;re actually living their lives without oil , so if they &apos;re on the line , they tell us where they live , and then they &apos;re getting video of how much information , how they &apos;re going to affect food , how much in real time .
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ing it since the last three years .
and i can tell you it was a transforma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ venture and you say , &quot; we &apos;re out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ venture that you &apos;re walking towards .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have kept the hab@@ its that are in the game .
so for the next world record , we set up a bigger , higher goal than just oil sp@@ ill .
we developed the game &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct &quot; at the institute of the future .
the starting point is to compu@@ te a super@@ computer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global mortality system , &quot; of course .
the call to gam@@ ers to sign up , we created almost like a jer@@ ry gro@@ ss movie .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , where there &apos;s the dre@@ am team . they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ beach fl@@ ing , and they can only save the world together .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say everybody is in the dre@@ am team , and it &apos;s our job of creating the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;
and the last game we bring out on mar@@ ch three . it &apos;s a game in collabor@@ ation with the world bank .
when you close the game , you get the a@@ ward from the world bank , &quot; social change , &quot; by 2010 .
we work with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa and invi@@ te them to learn social re@@ design .
we have a com@@ ic about this . we have levels high for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
i want to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in development areas that benefit from having their own social enter@@ pris@@ es together to save the world .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , happy produ@@ ctivity , the ability to reach close social networks , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
i really hope that we play together significant games to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me like this .
when i look forward in the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can create any imag@@ in@@ able future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games start !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that came up with me a couple of months ago writing an itali@@ an wired article .
i &apos;ve always been gri@@ pping my syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary , but i &apos;ve done the work of writing , and it occur@@ red to me that i &apos;ve never pro@@ posed in my life what the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the ent@@ ry .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ je@@ ctive : &quot; cra@@ w@@ ling , hel@@ pl@@ ess , dis@@ rup@@ ted , dead , mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ted , wo@@ unded , wo@@ unded , dis@@ car@@ ded , la@@ zy , dis@@ connected , bal@@ an@@ ced , im@@ po@@ tent , im@@ po@@ tent , paraly@@ zed , dis@@ placed , na@@ iled , na@@ sty , na@@ ked .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend out l@@ oud , and i had to lau@@ gh for the first time , it worked so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i just came up to &quot; cour@@ t , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t keep talking , and i had to stop reading and colle@@ ct myself from this tran@@ scen@@ dent wor@@ d@@ scap@@ e and sho@@ cked emotional .
of course , this was a perfect syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i just thought the out@@ put must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s when i was just starting element@@ ary school and began to build and form my self-@@ image outside my family around me , in terms of other kids and the rest of me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary at the time .
if i took that post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me could percei@@ ve as a person whose life can &apos;t be positive , but today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunity and ad@@ venture that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called myself up the online copy of 2009 , expe@@ cting me to find a pro@@ per contribu@@ tion here .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this ent@@ ry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and in particular , the last two words under near ant@@ ony are all about healthy .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in this words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
our language affe@@ cts our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ man , have really believed that the language of an es@@ cape has a huge force because what you &apos;re talking about is also mani@@ fest .
so , what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led person or a powerful person ?
a human being , remark@@ ably , could reach out to be min@@ d@@ less as a child , restri@@ ct them and over@@ come them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open do@@ ors to you ?
a person who opened do@@ ors for me was my pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ington in dolph@@ ins .
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o . an it@@ al@@ o american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak corre@@ ctly . so he was always called dr. p@@ .
and dr. p@@ . always wor@@ e very color@@ ful flies and was just like creating for work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physi@@ o@@ therapy .
i had to often repe@@ at individual practice with these th@@ ick , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- different colors -- you know , to build my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these ben@@ ches more than anything . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
and imagine i even negoti@@ ated as a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . so i tried to stop these practice , naturally without success .
and one day he watched me in one of my exer@@ cis@@ es -- these exer@@ cis@@ es were just ti@@ ring and gu@@ il@@ ty -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to te@@ ar those b@@ ars one day .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p@@ . so i did the exer@@ cis@@ es that i didn &apos;t want to do with the pro@@ spe@@ ct that many five-@@ year-old girls in the clin@@ ic in the second floor , but actually got me to see my daily practice hor@@ ror with new eyes .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me sha@@ ped my self as a strong and powerful young girl , and so i could imagine seeing myself as one of nature of strong and powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ al .
this is just one example of many ways adults can stimu@@ late the imagination of a child .
but as the already civili@@ zed examples from syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we would all wish : to allow anyone to see themselves as a powerful person .
our language incre@@ ases the social change that has been tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed in many cases by a technologi@@ cal change .
from the medical stand@@ point , of course , you can say that my legs , the las@@ er surgery for visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , k@@ nee jo@@ in@@ ts of ti@@ tan and artificial hi@@ p jo@@ in@@ ts for a@@ ge-@@ old bodies that allow people to actually use their own possibilities and to move beyond the bor@@ ders that their natural fa@@ te in the world .
so maybe this technologi@@ cal change indi@@ c@@ ates that ever since there was a different truth , that every human being can give something special and very powerful and that human ability to ada@@ pt is our biggest plus .
the human ability to ada@@ pt -- this is an interesting story , because people ask me over and over again to tell me how i deal with wi@@ dri@@ ties , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never mat@@ ched for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very un@@ comfortable about ans@@ wer@@ ing the questions of people and why i understand why .
this phr@@ ase of dealing with wi@@ der@@ ness lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on ma@@ ster@@ ing a challenge without being sha@@ ped by a connected experience , as if my life had been so successful , because i could take the pro@@ s@@ thetic face of a pro@@ s@@ thetic life as well as a human being .
but the truth is that we change . of course we are sha@@ ped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotion@@ ally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
wi@@ der@@ ness is not an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to cur@@ ve to better deal with our lives .
wi@@ el@@ ds are simply among our lives .
and i tend to think of wi@@ el@@ ties as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s har@@ dly to see , but it &apos;s with me all the time .
and i don &apos;t want to have any impact what@@ so@@ ever , to break down the heavy of a human fight .
there are wi@@ ves and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just too real , and each person is about it differently , but the question is not whether we deal with vi@@ tality or not , but how we deal with it .
so not only are we responsible for preser@@ ving the people we love from f@@ at@@ ali@@ ties , but also prepar@@ ing them to deal with it well .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt .
you have two things to be clear : for one thing , for medical fact , am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated and for the other , the social opini@@ on of whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
and to be honest , the only real and per@@ si@@ stent dis@@ ability i had to deal with is that the world is constantly meant , it could describe me with these defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect the people who care about us , and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical for@@ ec@@ ast , or even to provide a for@@ ec@@ ast about quality of life that they expect , we have to watch out that we don &apos;t actually have someone dis@@ ab@@ led .
maybe the current concept that &apos;s just paying attention to what &apos;s in a broken , and how we fix that , for each one , is a greater dis@@ ability than the path@@ ology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holi@@ st@@ ically , and not take all its forces and possibilities and recognize , we will create , in addition to the natural struggle you may have to lead , another disease .
we de@@ grade a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond pat@@ ology and focus on all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , there is a connection between the perception of our in@@ ade@@ qu@@ acy and our great inv@@ ent@@ or mind .
we shouldn &apos;t den@@ y or den@@ y these challen@@ ging times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor should we turn them under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing od@@ ds .
i &apos;m perhaps more likely to think that we don &apos;t necessarily have to over@@ come wi@@ el@@ di@@ ties , but that we &apos;re open to embra@@ ce them , pac@@ king them on the shar@@ p , also use a fight expression and maybe even dan@@ cing with them .
and maybe we can &apos;t see wi@@ el@@ ds as anything that is natural and as@@ ser@@ tive and useful and feel so har@@ as@@ sed by their pres@@ ence .
that year we celebra@@ te the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , poin@@ ted to something very true in the human character .
i would re@@ write it this way : not the most powerful of its kind , and not the intelligent one of its species , but the one that can best ada@@ pt change .
conflict emer@@ ges creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is determin@@ ed by the struggle of the human mind to transform through conflict .
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the greatest human abilities .
and we may only know which wood we &apos;re cut from when we &apos;re really te@@ sted .
maybe that &apos;s the sense of wi@@ el@@ ness , a sense of per@@ cep@@ tions , is a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give res@@ ili@@ ence a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
maybe we can see wi@@ el@@ ds as a change .
jo@@ y@@ ness is a change we haven &apos;t yet adap@@ ted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve ad@@ ded ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one , but not the normal one , and would you really want to know this poor , gra@@ y person if they really were ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great if we could un@@ lock this paradig@@ m of normal@@ ity to another possibility or streng@@ th , to even make it a little bit more dangerous , we can un@@ le@@ ash the forces of very many children and invi@@ te them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
anthropo@@ c@@ ene has found that we &apos;ve always asked people from the members of our society to be useful and to contribu@@ te .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , have contribu@@ ted older people and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and this may have happened because life experience was valuable in the survival butt@@ on of these people for society .
they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city i grew up in a food market in that red zone in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there in front of a sch@@ eff@@ el to@@ ma@@ to .
it was summer , and i had shor@@ ts .
and i hear a guy behind me say , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; exc@@ use me , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot;
oh , so that one .
and of course , it did click .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i only knew from narra@@ tives of my mother about that day , because , of course , i was typical about two weeks to my birthday .
my mother &apos;s office was on vac@@ ation , so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no legs , and my feet turned to them , and i only had a few to@@ es on this one and a few to@@ es on the other foot , he was the bridge , this stran@@ ger had to deliver bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk and would never be as mobile as other kids or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they &apos;ve just pun@@ ished me . &quot;
what was really extraordinary to me was he was colle@@ cting new@@ spa@@ pers from my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won at a sp@@ elling competition in grade two , whether i &apos;d gone with the path@@ ways at par@@ ade for hal@@ lo@@ ween , whether i &apos;d won my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or a medical student of mine .
and he called this part of his clas@@ ses the x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t just em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze how important this factor can be for the quality of a human life .
and dr. ke@@ an continued to say , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t constantly get said something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you leave kids alone , then children can do a lot . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and like someone , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me when i was 15 years old , if i had swa@@ pped my pro@@ s@@ thes@@ es against meat and b@@ ones , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated a second .
i really wanted to be normal back then .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this has happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , rather than despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed so many people who have opened do@@ ors to me , rather than en@@ counter people who wanted to con@@ stra@@ in me or over@@ come me an idea .
you see , it really takes only one person to demon@@ strate to you how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activ@@ ate their own inner power@@ s -- the human mind is so re@@ com@@ men@@ ded -- if you can do that , and open a door for somebody at a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open do@@ ors themselves .
the real meaning of the word edu@@ cate is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the word edu@@ ce .
it means getting something out of one is ti@@ ck@@ ling out the potential .
again , what potential do we want to dis@@ ru@@ pt ?
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , a case study was done in britain , and then gy@@ m@@ n@@ asia were trans@@ formed in total schools .
they call this stre@@ aming trials in the united states , we call this &quot; tra@@ cking . &quot;
the students are shared with notes .
and the a student gets te@@ sted ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly , gets better teachers and so on .
they then , over a three-@@ month period of time , students with a &quot; ab@@ und@@ ant &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; they told them they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote in .
and of course , it brea@@ ks your heart up to you to hear that vice ver@@ sa students were told that they were only suff@@ i@@ cient .
and it was the same after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except for the students who had failed school .
and the key thing about this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t in@@ fer@@ red .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the one-@@ person students , and they &apos;re enough students with the grade , and they taught them something and they treated them .
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind that has no more hope . he fin@@ ds nothing more beautiful . he l@@ ac@@ ks our natural childhood curi@@ osity , and our in@@ na@@ te ability of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human mind , we continue to hope to find ourselves and other people around themselves , to be curious and phan@@ tom , we really put our forces in a positive way .
if a mind has these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new mo@@ des of being .
i want to end with a po@@ em that was written by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , and my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; every child knows god , not the name of god , not always .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , by few changes in your genes , you could have a better memory -- more pre@@ cise , more pre@@ cise and more quickly .
or want to be fit@@ ter , stron@@ ger , more force .
would you like to become more attra@@ ctive and confi@@ dent ?
how about living longer in good health ?
or maybe they are one of those who have always lon@@ ged for more creativity .
which would you like the most ?
which would you like to have if it could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a couple . probably about as many creative people there are here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fit@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is all this just education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been an on@@ going theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s subject .
the great gene@@ tics in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ ator in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an es@@ say , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in li@@ t of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the pro@@ of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch off your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can still take a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s talk , because it &apos;s not going to be about it .
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it good for others or for us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve la@@ id a bush as a center of des@@ pair in all dire@@ ctions , because if you look at the mar@@ g@@ ins of life , all the species that exi@@ sted on the ti@@ ps of these bran@@ ches have had success : they survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated its environment and streng@@ th .
the human part of that bush , way to the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we bran@@ ch from a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ e about six or eight million years ago .
in that period of time , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re fairly remote from the other parts of life , but in fact most part , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms of our cells are quite the same .
do you realize that we can use this and actually en@@ able the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of the human insu@@ lin , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic ?
this is not like human@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemi@@ cally un@@ dist@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of pan@@ cre@@ as .
and as we talk about bacteria , do you realize that every one of us in our gut has more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times the number .
i mean , do you think when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks her self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospit@@ ality environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all the nutri@@ ents that they only wish for without effort on their part .
it &apos;s really a ligh@@ t@@ weight way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal inter@@ rup@@ tions of un@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ ch forced to es@@ cape .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria just as important to their lives .
they help di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve food , and they protect it against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
are we in some sort of evolutionary balance in a species ?
or are we wired to be something else -- something that might be even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 trilli@@ on years ago -- earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first sig@@ ns of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular organisms , maybe the last 800 years or then human species -- in the last billion years .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is only short for a second ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single one , and human life , a small not@@ ation .
that &apos;s us .
this is also the sub@@ mission of this speech , so i hope d hat@@ red you liked .
now , when i was a nin@@ ul@@ ing in college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental in most of the lives of soli@@ d organisms , each cell divi@@ des , and all the genetic information of the cell continu@@ es in both daughter cells .
but at the time , as multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organisms began to change .
sexual re@@ production comes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , the genome continu@@ es , the rest of the body becomes de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
in fact , you could say that the ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ability of the death of our body in evolution at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
now i have to conf@@ ess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with every year , it came to my growing dou@@ bt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who introduced his show in las v@@ eg@@ as in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck on his hotel room door .
he op@@ ens the door .
there &apos;s a beautiful sp@@ are about him in clo@@ thing sho@@ w@@ girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to the reali@@ zation that as a doctor , i worked on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ ct@@ ory , just different .
i tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to re@@ store health after disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the pas@@ sing of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survival after generation .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , they and i have evolved like bo@@ ster ro@@ cket to send genetic questi@@ oning to the next level of orbit to fall into the sea .
i think we would all be able to understand the mo@@ od that woo@@ dy allen understood when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean pre@@ fer@@ ring the lon@@ gest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the stron@@ gest , the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the bri@@ gh@@ test .
evolution privi@@ le@@ ges the creatures that fit best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
because of the ocean , there are bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and therefore the hot ste@@ am survival otherwise , if fish were there , it would be vac@@ u@@ um coo@@ ked fish , and yet they managed to make it a habit@@ able environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and particularly how we look forward in the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason that we were able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise cho@@ sen and would have been re@@ moved from the population .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have con@@ fig@@ uring out our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , that they ada@@ pt to us just as we ada@@ pt to them .
and by the way , we wan@@ der and cir@@ cul@@ ate and mix so much that they can &apos;t say isol@@ ation is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , im@@ posed on nature &apos;s forces .
and the argument here is that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly gr@@ in@@ ding , but they &apos;re in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble .
and as far as isol@@ ation as we col@@ oni@@ ze away as a species , there will be isol@@ ation and changes in the environment that evolution could naturally produce .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a lo@@ vely , fascinating and terri@@ fying possibility .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that &apos;s not easy , but led and decided , as an individual , to the choices we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be that we do that ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people now , in some cultures , make decisions about their off@@ spring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to assu@@ me genetic adap@@ tations that would he@@ al and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce risk of cancer or stro@@ ke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
as we look ahead , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in it to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome at about 20@@ ,000 dollars and the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t take long to be reality that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genom@@ es , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
one week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering lo@@ aded the dra@@ per prize for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ no@@ ld and wild ste@@ mmer , two scientists who developed indepen@@ d@@ ently the natural process of evolution to go faster and lead wi@@ sh@@ ing proteins in a more efficient way -- that fran@@ c@@ ise .
a few years ago , the las@@ er prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took a adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bla@@ ste , and through manipu@@ lation of only four genes indu@@ ced the cell to lead it to a plu@@ ri@@ poten@@ tially born cell .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that human insu@@ lin can make in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t only protect themselves , but can also serve imm@@ unity to other viruses .
believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study going on with vaccine for influ@@ enz@@ a that &apos;s been built into the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
can you imagine something good that comes out of to@@ bac@@ co ?
this is all reality today , and in the future it will be much more possible .
imagine just two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts ?
what if you could change the sper@@ m and eg@@ g cells or new@@ ly ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g to give your children a better chance to live a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ation of diabetes , re@@ move the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
and then analy@@ tical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also give us goo@@ d@@ b@@ ye to super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- better memory .
why not have the phr@@ ase of one ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can exp@@ and it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
why not have the fast mus@@ cles that will allow them to walk faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want , we will be trans@@ formed from al@@ t-@@ style to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process which generally requires 100,000 years , and we can comp@@ ress it for a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
these are decisions that your grand@@ children , or your grand@@ children have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , which is more successful , which is more friend@@ ly ?
or will we sele@@ ctively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society of di@@ el@@ ary and uni@@ form@@ ity , or ro@@ bu@@ ster and diversity ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and the deep@@ est of all , will we ever be able to develop wisdom and master the wisdom we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions wise ?
in good like evil and early than you might think , these decisions will be about us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something now , a port@@ able robot that gives you human ability , or another that helps whe@@ el@@ chair dri@@ vers stand up and go back .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
they &apos;re not anything but something that you put in the morning that will give you extra streng@@ th and will increase your speed further and will help them keep your balance , for example .
this is actually the true con@@ fusion of human and machine .
but not only that -- they mer@@ ge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about american soldiers on average , wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the requ@@ est to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ j@@ ury , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic in@@ j@@ ury .
so we thought we would embra@@ ce this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to h@@ ul@@ c now -- or the universal load car@@ rier .
soldi@@ er : with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds on different ter@@ rain for many hours .
its flexi@@ ble design allows you to ho@@ ok deep , cra@@ w@@ l and ex@@ ec@@ ute highly agi@@ le movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my streng@@ th and lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
we &apos;re here with our industrial partners in this device to imagine this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at the whe@@ el@@ chair dri@@ vers , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people glob@@ ally esti@@ ma@@ ted sitting in a whe@@ el@@ chair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive estimate .
we &apos;re talking about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries in their lifetime -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- being hit by fa@@ te , and the whe@@ el@@ chair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number multi@@ pli@@ es .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain impact , or other compli@@ cations -- is the whe@@ el@@ chair .
and so , by the way , for 500 years , since his , i &apos;ve been saying , very successful introdu@@ ction .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
now , let me introduce you to ele@@ gs , which is car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ ered a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury 19 years ago , which has conclu@@ ded that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , am@@ anda is our eleph@@ ant .
it has sen@@ s@@ ors .
his completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sen@@ s@@ ors in the cru@@ t@@ ches , send back signals to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ computer , which is atta@@ ched here on her back .
here are bat@@ ter@@ ings pac@@ k@@ aging , the engine engine engine is on your hi@@ ps , as well as your k@@ ne@@ es that you move forward in this fairly smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly and very natural gan@@ g@@ art .
i was 24 years old and best , when a mon@@ str@@ ous pure tree was paraly@@ zed by a sk@@ i ride .
in the fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my bas@@ in .
not long after that , a doctor step into my clin@@ ic , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;re never going to be able to go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every fif@@ th hope from my consciousness .
ada@@ pt@@ able technologies have since made it possible for me to learn how to sk@@ i again and cli@@ mb and even ride with my hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and disc@@ uss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the whe@@ el@@ chair dri@@ vers , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin hood .
if i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fire@@ man &apos;s main man in a volunte@@ er sol@@ ving the train .
well , in our city , volunte@@ ers suppor@@ ted a highly sk@@ ill@@ ed professional fire@@ men , you have to be at the brand quite early to be able to mix with you .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er at the brand site , so i had pretty good opportunities to be able to go in .
but it was still a race against the other volunte@@ ers to reach the responsible head@@ man and figure out what our job would be .
when i found the main man , he had a very serious conversation with the home ow@@ ner who had certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the pa@@ jam@@ as and bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen in the rain flo@@ wing while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ er who had just arrived before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- reached the main man first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the house ow@@ ner .
the dog ! i was sta@@ tic .
there was some law@@ yer or wealth admini@@ str@@ ators who could now tell the rest of his life that he went to a burning house to save a living cre@@ ature just because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next one .
the main man wave me .
he said , &quot; be@@ zo@@ s , you &apos;ve got to go into the house .
you have to go up , pass by the fire , and this woman has to get some shoes . &quot;
i swe@@ ar it .
now , not exactly what i hop@@ ed to do , but i went up -- the sta@@ irs up , down the hall@@ s , past the true fire@@ men who had already been quite ready to go to the bedro@@ om to get some shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i car@@ ried my pre@@ y back down , where i met my ene@@ my at the front door and the belo@@ ved dog .
we wor@@ e our esti@@ mates outside to the home ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the fire@@ men received a letter from the home ow@@ ner in which they than@@ ked themselves for the bra@@ ve de@@ plo@@ y@@ ment of their house .
one about all valu@@ ed kin@@ dness : somebody actually had brought her some shoes .
both in my prof@@ ession with ro@@ bin hood and my career as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i am wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness at large , but i also see acts of kin@@ dness and the mu@@ d of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i look around this room and see people who have either achie@@ ved an ac@@ compli@@ shed success , or are on their way there , i want to offer a remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in someone else &apos;s life until they reached their first million .
if you have to give something , now you give it .
serve in a sou@@ p kitchen , clean up a park in the neighborhood .
be a ment@@ or .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save a person &apos;s life , but every day allows us to change one .
so go ahead , save the shoes .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret to humanity &apos;s pro@@ gr@@ ession .
a place where women take the reci@@ pes with sex saying hell@@ o , and the game determin@@ es the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not like you or san francisco .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tives .
this is the wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s world in the forest of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are our next living rela@@ tives along with chimpanze@@ es .
that means we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ven@@ ess .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ st@@ ated this issue in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of me@@ d@@ al .
whereas chimpanze@@ es are led by great , sc@@ ary c@@ and@@ les , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ o society is led by em@@ powered fe@@ males .
they really came up with something , because that leads to a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly toler@@ ant society where de@@ ad@@ ly violence has not been obser@@ ved .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known under pri@@ mates .
they live in the deep con@@ gol@@ ese ur@@ b@@ ani@@ um forest , and it &apos;s hard to see .
con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dark@@ ness itself -- the fo@@ am of a violent argument that has been ra@@ ging for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destru@@ ction also thre@@ at@@ ens the survival of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
meat trade and the de@@ cre@@ ase of the tree is that you couldn &apos;t even fill a sta@@ dium with the rema@@ ined bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden lau@@ ghter that the trees are sha@@ king .
who are these rela@@ tives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have common , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , inter@@ acting partners , and rules of conflict and social angel@@ s .
i &apos;m not saying this is the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the life of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is made up of more than the cam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like humans -- love playing their lives long .
play is not just child games .
for us and it &apos;s game essential for conne@@ cting relationships and care for toler@@ ance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play incre@@ ases creativity and res@@ ili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about gener@@ ating diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s play , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human la@@ kes , dance and ri@@ tu@@ als .
play is the ti@@ ck@@ le that hol@@ ds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images right from the wild .
first of all , a ball game in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i don &apos;t think of so@@ c@@ cer .
so here &apos;s a young female and males in a tra@@ cking game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
that could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; she puts it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
only i think he li@@ kes it more , right ?
yeah !
so sex games are distribu@@ ted , both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ide@@ al wealth of getting new elements into play -- like the te@@ stic@@ les -- and also how the game needs both trust and pro@@ mot@@ es -- while simul@@ tane@@ ously making it incredibly fun .
but the game is a sha@@ pe@@ -@@ shif@@ ter .
play is a sha@@ pe@@ -@@ shif@@ ter , and it can take on a lot of forms that some of which are a little bit more quiet , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- perhaps to re@@ discover the ast@@ on@@ ishing .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful with water .
i think just as they play us sometimes alone , and we &apos;re bor@@ ro@@ wing our inner and ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that makes us explore and interact , and the un@@ expected lin@@ ked that we create is really the nutri@@ ent ground of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s give us to our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future in which we need to ada@@ pt to more and more challenges , through greater creativity and prin@@ ts , co@@ operation .
the secret is that the game is key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tation jo@@ ker .
in order to success@@ fully ada@@ pt to an in@@ consi@@ stent world , we have to play .
but are we going to make the best out of our to@@ y drive ?
play is not sil@@ ly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people the same way , life is not made of teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
even when it doesn &apos;t seem to be har@@ dly appropriate , perhaps the most necessary game .
and so , my pri@@ mate com@@ ra@@ des , let &apos;s hu@@ g this gift of evolution and play together while we re@@ discover creativity to cr@@ ony and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the mi@@ d-@@ 197@@ 9 , exactly the same day , at the same moment , each one is having a baby -- okay .
so two cou@@ ples , each one is a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the creation , because if you think about gener@@ ating all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ario , imagine that in one case , sper@@ m car@@ ries a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m hit@@ ting the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m car@@ ries an x chromo@@ some that h@@ its the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
they are vi@@ able , they &apos;re both in@@ expensive .
we &apos;ll go back to these guys later .
for most of my activi@@ ties , i have two hat@@ s .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the history of an@@ atom@@ y .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian , and in this case , i study how people were dealing with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they were dealing with body flu@@ ids , with body concep@@ ts , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i did at my work is the activ@@ ist , as a patient law@@ yer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient law@@ yer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have physical guys who are asking social nor@@ ms .
so for example , i worked with people who are si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with d@@ war@@ fs -- so people who were smaller than common .
and i worked very often with inter@@ sexual people whose gender is at@@ yp@@ ical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality occur@@ s in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of gender vari@@ ants that don &apos;t con@@ form to male or female standard .
in one case , you may have someone with an x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ es , and the s@@ ry gene of y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s leaves the proto@@ gon@@ ads we all have with fet@@ al sta@@ dium to grow up to te@@ stic@@ les .
and so the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one is giving off the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one in the fet@@ al days .
but because this individual is missing the re@@ cept@@ ors to see the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic re@@ cept@@ or de@@ fe@@ ct .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more to the typical female course of this .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually until they reach pu@@ ber@@ ty and their brea@@ sts grow and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody comes to the fact that there &apos;s something different here .
and they do some tests and they find that instead of eg@@ gs and u@@ ter@@ us , they actually carry in and they have a y chromo@@ some .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person as actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ines .
they &apos;re in the back of our bodies .
and by the way , the and@@ ro@@ gens that are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
most women , like me , i think , are a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ som@@ es , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually respond to and@@ ro@@ gens .
we produce and@@ ro@@ gens , and we respond to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was ex@@ posed more and@@ ro@@ gens than a woman who was born with te@@ stic@@ les and has an and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic re@@ cept@@ or de@@ fe@@ ct .
so gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sexual standing not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread across all the band@@ wid@@ th .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had raised a friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he had just found out he had eg@@ er@@ sticks and a u@@ ter@@ us .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side cat@@ tle hyper@@ bla@@ d@@ der .
he has x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his side kid@@ ne@@ ys were so highly active that they basically created a male hor@@ m@@ one environment .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ al@@ y was male , his brain was ex@@ posed to the more typical male part of the hor@@ m@@ one spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one knew anything .
and it was only when he turned 19 that he got enough medical problems , actually because he was inside the men@@ stru@@ ating doctors that he was female inside .
okay , just one quick example of one vari@@ ant in inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop something called o@@ vot@@ est@@ ic@@ a , which is wra@@ pped around o@@ vari@@ an tissue of den@@ se tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occu@@ r in many different vari@@ ants .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fs or si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins , whether it &apos;s inter@@ sexual -- often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ m from surge@@ ons is not because this would be advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous to their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often do different kinds of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain an@@ atom@@ ical lea@@ p comes in with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman means having a female identity ; being a black person is supposed to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of its own story .
so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually represents something very different for us , it conf@@ uses us in terms of those categ@@ ories .
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , which are two people in a body .
where i &apos;d seen most exciting recently was the south african run@@ ner ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender was questi@@ oned at the lei@@ ch@@ at@@ le@@ th@@ ic world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in ber@@ lin .
many journ@@ alists called me with the question , &quot; what test are you going to do to tell us whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists that there was no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit that nature doesn &apos;t attra@@ ct a line between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex@@ ually and female and inter@@ sex@@ ually ; we tend to be the dis@@ connect line as natural .
so we have this situation where , the further our science pro@@ gr@@ esses , we have to stand around so much that these categ@@ ories that we thought are more rob@@ ust an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which made very simple arr@@ ange@@ ments to create perman@@ ent identity sk@@ at@@ ories than we did .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology allowed .
in our view , we went to all sorts of in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
for example , we are star@@ ing at the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
what should we do with the fact that we diff@@ er from them just by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
as we continue to push our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of dis@@ com@@ fort , where we need to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we probably had are too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different forms of human life .
one of the areas in which we see this for the second , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about where a body becomes human , so that it has a different right than the fet@@ al life .
we have very difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when is someone dead ?
our ancestors had never had that hard to deal with the question of when someone was dead .
they kept a bu@@ g under their nose , and when she moved , they haven &apos;t bu@@ ried them yet .
if it didn &apos;t move , you &apos;d dig it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people &apos;s vi@@ tal organs and we want to plant them to other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re caught in the fight with the really difficult question of when someone &apos;s dead , and that &apos;s what makes us a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categ@@ ories as we used to .
now you might think that the whole collap@@ se of categ@@ ories would make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m pro@@ gressi@@ ve political , i de@@ f@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , i &apos;m nervous .
to realize that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought , i &apos;m excited about .
and i &apos;m excited about this in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this ten@@ sion , i have to first know that i am a big fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i know they were bi@@ ased , i know they were more sex@@ ist , but they were great .
i think they were so bra@@ ve and so radi@@ cally , in what they were doing , every few years , looking at the nar@@ row musi@@ cal music in 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened to the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers in 17@@ 7@@ 6 .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , in my view , were the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
what they pro@@ ved back was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they re@@ placed it through another that was radi@@ cally and beautiful , and for 200 years was pre@@ cise for us .
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and mon@@ arch@@ y was based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
the ma@@ sters of the ancient world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth rights .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were hop@@ ing that people who had political power should have that political power because of the in@@ her@@ ited blood line from the grand@@ father to the son and so on .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers showed this idea back and re@@ placed it through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all humans were created equ@@ ally .
they ni@@ vel@@ li@@ zed the play@@ ground , and they decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , the common ground , they didn &apos;t matter the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things grew together .
democracy grew in , but at the same time , the science grew in .
if you look at the story of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it turns out that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world .
they went away from explan@@ ations of super@@ natural ways , and they showed things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back where trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ tive concept of birth right .
they moved to a natural concept .
and for example , if you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they created a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ali@@ ties .
and so they &apos;ve really prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women who as@@ pi@@ red the ele@@ ction right , the concept of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , which says that an@@ atom@@ ic com@@ mon@@ ality is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ o and ir@@ on than difference , that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote .
and women argu@@ ed this success@@ fully .
the next thing was the successful civil rights movement where we saw people like so@@ bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cks , who sp@@ ach , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the mar@@ sh@@ ing ro@@ ws of the citi@@ zen@@ ship movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color based on an@@ atom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ali@@ ties before an@@ atom@@ ical differences , again , successful .
we see the same with the dis@@ ab@@ led legal movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the simil@@ ari@@ ties , we have to start asking why we main@@ tain certain di@@ visi@@ ons .
well , i want to susta@@ in certain di@@ visi@@ ons , an@@ atom@@ ically seen , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from an@@ atom@@ y .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-@@ ol@@ ds should be right to give their in@@ sight to sex or to mar@@ ry .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical separ@@ ations that make sense to me , and that we , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether it makes sense .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been wit@@ n@@ essed at the beginning of the talk .
we wit@@ n@@ essed two creatures in the middle of 197@@ 9 on exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , was born three months old , so she was born on jun@@ e 1 , 19@@ 80 .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born for the birthday minister , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch one in 19@@ 80 .
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months old , she ear@@ ns all sorts of rights three months before h@@ ein@@ rich -- to have the right to choose sex to drink the right .
h@@ ein@@ rich has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the ti@@ mel@@ ine of his birth .
we find other od@@ di@@ ties about what their rights are .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assu@@ me he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s the one with x@@ y -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now be brought in what mar@@ ia doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
mar@@ ia , in all states , cannot percei@@ ve the same right that h@@ ein@@ rich in all states has the right to mar@@ ry .
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ia , in every state , mar@@ ia can mar@@ ia only mar@@ ry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that are proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able in many ways .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science makes such progress in the real@@ m of an@@ atom@@ y that we have to get to a point where we have to say that a democracy that is based on an@@ atom@@ y might fall apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up on science , but at the same time it feels like science is doing itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is taking some kind of pra@@ g@@ matic post@@ ure : &quot; well , we have to draw a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point decided that to mar@@ ry a man doesn &apos;t have a chromo@@ some , and to mar@@ ry a woman means you have a y chromo@@ some .
now in practice , people are not te@@ sted on their chromo@@ some .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re because of the story i told you about the and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic re@@ cept@@ or de@@ fe@@ ct .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t ju@@ dge people by &quot; their skin color , but by the characteri@@ stic of their character , &quot; and then go beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ju@@ dge people because of their tra@@ its ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of people , because i have to ad@@ mit that i know a series of gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever that probably deser@@ ve soci@@ ally than some people i know .
i want to say that i probably know some bright lab@@ ra@@ dor@@ dogs that are more capable , more intelligent and ri@@ cher decisions about their sexual relationships than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds i know .
so how do we oper@@ ate the question for the characteri@@ stics of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and one part of me wonder , what if the content of a person@@ ality was something that would be machine in the future -- could be made visible through the f@@ mr@@ i ?
do we really want to go this way ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it really seems to be important to think about the idea that the united states is leadership to worry about questions about democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing really well , and i think we &apos;d be doing our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation of what it &apos;s like in iran , for example , where a man who is dra@@ wn sex@@ ually to other men who is pun@@ ished to die with is because he &apos;s willing to under@@ go a sexual transformation in which case he can stay alive .
the states of this species don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m g@@ la@@ d to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surge@@ on i spoke to a few years ago who had brought some si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins to separate them , in part to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he was doing these sur@@ ger@@ ies -- they were highly ris@@ ky sur@@ ger@@ ies -- his answer was that in his country , these children were being treated very poor@@ ly , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well did you consider political as@@ y@@ l rather than having surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states has incredible opportunities to allow people to be the people they are without having to change around the state of will .
so i think we need to be leadership .
well , just to conclu@@ de , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possibilities that democracy might look like , or could have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something radi@@ cally to a fe@@ min@@ ist , which is , i think , that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that go@@ ver@@ n different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people apply group thinking .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in gender difference .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve seen from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- tend to give a lot of complex social relationships and conc@@ ern for people who are vulner@@ able within the group .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my students asked me , who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , so doing it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ min@@ ism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stu@@ pi@@ dest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
fe@@ min@@ ism is about dis@@ solving stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so fe@@ min@@ ism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be something female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
that is to say there could be something on average , which is what female brains are different from male , which makes us more attention to highly complex social relationships and more al@@ ert to the prote@@ ctive needs .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely sus@@ pi@@ cious of fig@@ uring out how individuals could be prote@@ cted from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we could put more of a concept of , not just how to protect each other , but how to care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we &apos;re doing democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- think less about the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships .
so if we as a people try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and this is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
i love being able to take another color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , and have been photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging recently .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es from second hand on fle@@ w markets and in secon@@ d-@@ hand sh@@ ops .
o@@ oh , thank you .
secon@@ d-@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact of my gar@@ der@@ o@@ be to the environment and also the influence of my wal@@ let .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s sh@@ opp@@ ing for my personal ch@@ est .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
will i like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers were yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i &apos;ve pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
i brought seven under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
under@@ pants for exactly a week are all i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case .
i cri@@ ed that i would find everything else i could carry if i came to pal@@ m spr@@ ings first .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman walking around here at ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my out@@ f@@ its this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to tell you some of the lessons that i believe or not , have learned from these ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ers to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
all this out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece i wor@@ n all week .
mon@@ day : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ olo@@ gi@@ cally impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you attra@@ ct other happy people to be happy .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is totally over@@ r@@ ated .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and ada@@ pt at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re also going to estimate it .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day , hu@@ g your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i look like i &apos;m playing &apos; d@@ res@@ ses &apos; or i remember her se@@ ven@@ -year-old .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : self-@@ confi@@ dence is the key .
if you think you look good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you brie@@ fly .
if you think you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for somebody in this audience .
we should be able to ro@@ tate everything we want .
thank you .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : gol@@ den pa@@ il@@ ing mat@@ ches everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing a unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven over and over and over this week when people came to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
obviously , this is not going to fit in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate all that again .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week myself is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to call these things emotion@@ ally , because right around the corner there will always be another crazy , color@@ ful , bright out@@ fit that just waiting for me if i have a little love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good after@@ no@@ on , everybody together .
i have something here that i want to show you .
think of this as a visual point , as a flying point .
this is what we call per@@ cep@@ tual design in our lab .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting happened in the for@@ mul@@ a 1 in the last decade .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s monit@@ or@@ ed in real time , has a few thousand sen@@ s@@ ors that information from the car , pass that information to the system , and then use it to change that car back in real time and make information .
this would be what you call , in engineering teams , a re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made up of two parts -- a sen@@ sing part and a respon@@ sive ar@@ row .
what &apos;s interesting today is the re@@ al-@@ time control systems start to appear in our lives .
our cities have been , over the last few years , equi@@ pped with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
they become computers in the open .
and as a computer in the open , they start respon@@ ding in a different way , they &apos;re percei@@ ved and driven .
when we build cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population are there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of the co2 emis@@ sions .
so if we do something to cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this percei@@ ve and drive into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion , the pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i at mom@@ a later a year , organized during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like every at@@ om out there becomes a sen@@ sor and a gra@@ in .
and that radi@@ cally trans@@ forms the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sha@@ ped the mo@@ ses , it means he finally took the ham@@ mer and thre@@ w it to mo@@ ses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot underneath -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why can &apos;t you say ? &quot;
well , today , our environment , for the first time , begins to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , percei@@ ving and driving the idea of our environment .
let &apos;s start with percei@@ vation .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our lab@@ s .
four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and using anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from this network , which is now being colle@@ cted by oper@@ ators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was like it@@ al@@ y won the so@@ c@@ cer cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship of the world .
some of you will remember it was when it@@ al@@ y played against fr@@ ance , and then finally zi@@ dan@@ e , the head sho@@ ck .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end of it .
now look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see in the middle the colo@@ s@@ se@@ um , the ti@@ ver .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
in the old after@@ no@@ on , people here and there who are calling and moving .
the game begins -- sil@@ ence .
fr@@ ance makes a gate . it@@ al@@ y makes a gate .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a brief phone call , go to the toi@@ let .
second hal@@ f-@@ time . end of the normal game .
first exten@@ sion , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of head sho@@ ck .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
now that night , everybody went to the center to celebra@@ te .
they saw the great impact .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the se@@ vent@@ h team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the space about mas@@ sim@@ o , where since the ro@@ man time , people go to celebra@@ te -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
another quick example of feeling : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things we use and consu@@ me .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that a ma@@ c computer is made of , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so we actually designed some small mark@@ ers in this project to track the g@@ arb@@ age as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunte@@ ers who helped us a little over a year ago in se@@ att@@ le mar@@ ks the things they were thro@@ wing away -- different kinds of things you can see -- things that you would throw away anyway .
then we have the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , gl@@ u@@ ed into the tr@@ ash and started tra@@ cking it .
here are the results we just got .
from se@@ att@@ le ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of in@@ efficient in the system .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this happens to be a lot of un@@ useful tru@@ cks and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the tas@@ ks we throw away are not just disappe@@ aring that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re still thro@@ wing away every day .
and if we were to show that to people , then we can drive behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could percei@@ ve much more about that and the many other wonderful things you can percei@@ ve , tell you , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part that we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ te environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
it started with a question from the ma@@ yo@@ r who came to us and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology to it ?
and one of the ideas that was medi@@ ated at mit in a work@@ force was imagine these tu@@ bes , and val@@ ves , mag@@ net val@@ ves , val@@ ves , val@@ ves that open and close .
they do something like a water cur@@ tain with sc@@ or@@ es of water .
if these sc@@ or@@ es fall down , they can write on them , they can display patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it will open to make it jump through , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ hole .
he liked it very much .
and we got the mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the exp@@ o .
we called it pa@@ vi@@ lli@@ on in the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but as you approach it , it will open up and let you go in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s win@@ dy , if you want to reduce sy@@ ring@@ es , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that day when you drive down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destro@@ y the building , it &apos;s just so that architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who wonder@@ s what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sen@@ s@@ ors that opened the water up to not get we@@ t .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sen@@ s@@ ors stopped working .
but actually that night it was even more fun .
all the children from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to make it happen , but a building that still had brea@@ ks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting we@@ t .
and this was very exciting for us , because as archite@@ cts , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people , the things we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always un@@ predi@@ ctable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and inter@@ acting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical ima@@ ging points , the data points of water and the proje@@ ctions on it .
and this is what made us think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these ima@@ gery points could really start flying .
imagine you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters flying through the air , and each of you with a little turning point of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter like the one you saw earlier , moving with others , totally in syn@@ c .
you can have this cloud .
you can have some sort of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a smo@@ oth forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
or in@@ frequ@@ ently in three dimensions where what changes is light , not the position of the ima@@ gery .
you can play with different types .
imagine the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , different solutions .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of ima@@ ging points that you can go and pass through , that you can look at in many , many ways .
here you see a real fl@@ y@@ wire controll@@ er coming down to form an equal v like before .
when you turn on the light it looks like this , so the same as we saw before .
imagine that every single person is being controlled .
it could have a impul@@ se to every single point that comes from people , from the movement of people or so forth .
i want to show you something first here .
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the é@@ toi@@ le at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ il@@ and -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a moment@@ um for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
this is ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see the ima@@ gery , the different cap@@ tive im@@ pres@@ sions .
it &apos;s a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan and a motion recor@@ ding at the same time .
so they can understand the whole movement .
you can do this all the time .
but then once we have all the ima@@ gery , they can play with it and play with color gravity and motion .
we want to use that as a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
i want to show you the lat@@ est project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
again , the idea is , imagine building the cloud movement that we engage people again to do something and to change the environment -- almost as we call the clou@@ ds movement as you move a she@@ et out , but with a cloud .
imagine anybody can give a little don@@ ation to a point of view .
i think the remarkable thing about the last few years , the last decade , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the campaign ob@@ am@@ as showed this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of networks to the physical world .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to face the challenges coming -- think about climate change or co2 emis@@ sions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical ?
so the idea is that we actually engage people in the way that they do things , colle@@ ctively .
the cloud is again a cloud of ima@@ ging points in the same way as a really cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of points .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with data points .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , divi@@ de out the most important moments for olymp@@ ia of 20@@ 12 and darwin , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go to like london &apos;s new mountain sum@@ mit .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital glo@@ be at night -- but most importantly , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important in context .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a about 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg .
i &apos;m fri@@ ghten@@ ed .
my heart was di@@ zz@@ y , as i tried to grab what was in front of me .
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs ra@@ ped around me almost 60 meters out of the water , and i could only st@@ are that this was a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke by year .
ice mountains are born as a cal@@ f of a gl@@ ac@@ ier , or by brea@@ king out of ice she@@ ets .
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they interact with their environment in a very clear way and their experience .
some re@@ f@@ use to give up and bra@@ ce to the bit@@ ter end , while others stop and collap@@ se dra@@ matic passion in a case .
if you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separ@@ ated , and only , as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i brea@@ the its pre@@ cur@@ sor atmosphere .
during the ic@@ e@@ berg , it mel@@ ts out miner@@ al drin@@ king water that fe@@ e@@ ds many forms of life .
i go to my foot@@ age of these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i make portra@@ its of my ancestors , the awar@@ eness that they exist in this individual e@@ ye@@ -@@ looking of that way and will never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when they melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a continu@@ ation of their path along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i &apos;m facing is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images that i &apos;d like to show you are an ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you &apos;re actually wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing an es@@ cal@@ ating ic@@ e@@ berg .
so here it is .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please look at the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it &apos;s on the water line .
you can see here he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is standing there .
this is the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
it takes about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , let &apos;s show you the ic@@ e@@ berg another side of his person@@ ality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely bl@@ essed by work on some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is temp@@ t .
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists of the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs cri@@ b@@ ble . &quot;
and that was the er@@ up@@ tion of the thing .
temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
he can only use his eyes .
i fac@@ ed with him .
i have a company that makes design and anima@@ tions , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and pay attention to in the art world .
so we decided to support tony -- temp@@ t -- and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i haven &apos;t seen ste@@ phen ha@@ w@@ king -- can &apos;t all of the paraly@@ zed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you go to the higher social layer and have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can really do that .
normal people are not acc@@ essi@@ ble to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communic@@ ating ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly and the di@@ ving bell &quot; ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fing@@ ers walk along .
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need to just take a check , and instead i made a check that i didn &apos;t know how to fix it .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and father in place -- saying , &quot; well , my pro@@ pos@@ al is this : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i met these guys at gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw with a las@@ er poin@@ ter on it that only go@@ ver@@ ns the negative surface .
so they move around and they make art instal@@ lations like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
it starts with the sex cli@@ mbers , then the sh@@ ots come , after that , the bush le@@ verage and finally people do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
so i went home and had dinner with my wife and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to control a las@@ er so that it can be gra@@ ff@@ iti again . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached a few things .
first of all , we brought in the in@@ sur@@ ance of the do@@ ors , and we actually got a device that he can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen ha@@ w@@ king machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da because you talk to him , or you get an email , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ wor@@ thy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also fle@@ w seven programm@@ ers from around the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- home to us .
my wife and my children and i moved into the gar@@ age , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and programm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy theor@@ ist and archi@@ ves have taken over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and we came back and all the images on the walls were gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tis .
but for over two weeks , we programm@@ ed , we went to the beach m@@ all in ven@@ ice , my kids were involved , and my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought on the be@@ ach@@ es of ven@@ ice , a little bit of cop@@ per wire and some things from the building market and the electr@@ on@@ ics trade .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3@@ -@@ camera , we te@@ am@@ ed it apart , put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s open -- you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , you can down@@ load the software for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limit@@ ations .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can break .
no hospital .
any paraly@@ zed now can actually communicate or draw alone with your eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this rum@@ ble in front of the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , nu@@ del@@ par@@ ties and se@@ wing through , tony first dre@@ w after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we ti@@ ed his bed so he can look outside .
we set up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king lot in front of the hospital .
and he dre@@ w for the first time , in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what kind of feeling that was in the par@@ king lot .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we also had to break in the par@@ king lot , so we felt right as part of the spra@@ y scene .
in the end , he sent us an email with following content : &quot; for the first time in seven years , i &apos;ve done something .
i feel like i was cr@@ us@@ hed under@@ water , and finally somebody picked down and pulled my head up so i can brea@@ the . &quot;
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
that &apos;s something like our fight scre@@ am .
that kee@@ ps us going , and let &apos;s continue to evol@@ ve .
and we need to do much better on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic black@@ board .
and someone who has such an arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all sorts of recogni@@ tion .
we &apos;ve won some pri@@ ces .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ves it .
it all comes out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the a@@ wards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong t@@ we@@ et@@ ed about us and then , dec@@ ember , hon@@ or@@ ed us ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine when one of the 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est thing about this is -- and this clo@@ ses the whole circle -- that this apri@@ l , in the inner city of los angeles , there will be an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the tou@@ gh@@ est repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of the street scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these guys will be there .
temp@@ t will be part of the show , which is pretty de@@ ad@@ ly .
so basically , when you see something that &apos;s impossible , you make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a progra@@ mmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with au@@ gener@@ ative technology , but i &apos;ve just cap@@ tured something and surro@@ unded myself with amazing people so we could put something together .
and that question was to ask each of you , and that &apos;s every single day when you have to get something done . if not now , when ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most common children &apos;s auth@@ or .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get there like a scientist .
you can have me as a far@@ mer , or lea@@ ther , but no one has ever cho@@ sen any far@@ mer .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
well , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find because you dro@@ pped it somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ ual .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class@@ rooms .
i was the one who was be@@ aten in the virg@@ in o@@ ids green and blue every week until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life using the toi@@ let in the classroom .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 8@@ 5 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i loved one -- and at the time in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it important to do a work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from this teacher in the middle of the night , woman post saying , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never known each other as adults .
can you come to o@@ hi@@ o , please come together with the guy i know you &apos;ve found him now .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want you to hur@@ ry please . &quot;
well the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew they had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight because they needed it .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , met me , she turned into a box of ash and was put in my hands .
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation i talked about .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so g@@ la@@ d that this has been mentioned so often here today .
he needs the same thing -- he would need love and pleasure , and it &apos;s up to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you go up to 1,000 meters .
imagine an airplane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine a power plant that would cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
that sounds sc@@ ary .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ d .
i was the only one to talk to the air@@ port .
so i looked at her in a second , and they said , &quot; no problem , i think we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already memor@@ i@@ zed the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot did the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
it shu@@ ts down the engine .
imagine a no@@ is@@ y airplane .
and then he said three words -- the lo@@ west words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; make it available . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bor@@ ders anymore .
i could see it in her eyes , there was a hor@@ ror that life ended .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to hand and didn &apos;t do all the f@@ ences that i wanted to fli@@ ck , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
as i later thought about it , i found a phr@@ ase that says , &quot; i collect bad w@@ ine . &quot;
because if the w@@ ine is there and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to move anything more in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and that was when we mis@@ sed the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair bre@@ ad@@ th -- i thought , boy , there &apos;s one thing i really regre@@ t .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i as@@ pi@@ re to become better in everything i attac@@ ked .
but in my humanity , i also gave my e@@ go space .
and i took the time that i wa@@ sted for meaning@@ less things with people who mean something .
and i thought of the relationship with my wife , my friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to get negative energy out of my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i was no longer argu@@ ing with my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right anymore ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- while the inside clock starts coun@@ ting &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break up in 20 parts , as you know it from docum@@ ent@@ aries .
as we fall down , i had this feeling of dying , man , is not terri@@ fying .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really formed in one thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
about a month after that , i vis@@ ited a performance of my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not much arti@@ stic talent ...
... not yet .
and i celebra@@ te , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
i realized back then by conne@@ cting the dots to each other that life is all about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
i became part of the wonder of not dying that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
my call for those of you who fly today is : imagine the same thing happening on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you sho@@ ot because you think you &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents they can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bom@@ b .
the most important post there for developing nuclear weapons is the ur@@ an-@@ in@@ cen@@ tive facili@@ ty in nat@@ ance .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes you see here , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
now if we manage to com@@ pe@@ te the systems that control fil@@ es and val@@ ves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective windows virus on a laptop that &apos;s used by a war@@ ning engineer to con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a windows dr@@ one .
the us@@ age is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear energy program -- mission .
this is a children &apos;s game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started studying stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the meaning and purpose of this construction was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated in terms of the windows , the dro@@ p@@ per@@ - part , made by coun@@ t@@ less cer@@ o@@ -- da@@ y@@ - sch@@ ol@@ ar use .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
that brought our attention , and we started a lab project where we got infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we studied this constru@@ ct .
and then something weird happened .
stu@@ x@@ net was like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed out , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my mind .
and after experim@@ enting with different kinds of che@@ ese , i realized this was a tar@@ ge@@ ted attack .
completely focused on a particular goal .
the dro@@ p@@ let is active on the gra@@ y box when a special con@@ figu@@ ration was discovered , even when the special program that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct on that target .
and if not , then there &apos;s nothing going to do .
so that really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it may , for example , be an u.s. power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ ul@@ ated the attack code and found that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very profession@@ ally constru@@ cted by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information available .
they knew all bits and by@@ tes that they had to attack .
they probably even knew the size of the machine oper@@ ator .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already been told that the student drug is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , use data is a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much harder than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this cap@@ tured code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ bly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for was syste@@ m-@@ func@@ tion@@ ing calls because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we looked for ti@@ mers and data structures and tried to connect them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could record or dis@@ prove .
to put these theor@@ ies up , we call ourselves reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed that it &apos;s definitely high-@@ gra@@ ded sab@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a high-@@ quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infe@@ ctions have been repor@@ ted there .
well , there aren &apos;t several thousand goals in this area .
it &apos;s basically running out of the bu@@ re@@ e nuclear power plant and the in@@ cen@@ tive plant in nat@@ ance .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plants from our cli@@ ent tri@@ be . &quot;
and i called her , and i ta@@ pped her knowledge to compare her exper@@ ti@@ se to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital war@@ heads to the ro@@ tor@@ turing system .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part of the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and when you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you &apos;re actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and eventually even explo@@ de the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was to actually make it happen slowly and secre@@ tly -- obviously in the attemp@@ t to keep war@@ ning engineers des@@ per@@ ate so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind quickly .
the great digital war@@ head -- we got a gli@@ mp@@ se of it by looking at very pre@@ cis@@ ely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 is really out of this code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
i started working on scientific liter@@ ature about how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are built in nat@@ ance , and found that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in what &apos;s called cas@@ ca@@ des , and each cas@@ ca@@ de con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got even better .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran are divi@@ ded into 15 so@@ -@@ called levels .
and guess what we found in the code of attack ?
it &apos;s a almost iden@@ tical structure .
so again , the fit really well together .
and this gave us a lot of confi@@ dence in what we &apos;re studying here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results have been achie@@ ved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a dead gas and had to re@@ collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital war@@ heads were actually controll@@ ing the same goal , but from different dire@@ ctions .
the little war@@ head takes over a cas@@ ca@@ de , and roll@@ s the ro@@ tors and slo@@ ws them down , and the big head comes with six cas@@ ca@@ des in interaction and manipu@@ late val@@ ves .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually have determin@@ ed what the goal is .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just nat@@ ance .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s something really cool that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really taken me out of the so@@ cks .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
now , what this thing does is it cap@@ tures the sub@@ tle values of sen@@ s@@ ors -- which is , for example , from pressure sen@@ s@@ ors and vi@@ bra@@ tional sen@@ s@@ ors -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate code running during the attack , with fal@@ se data .
and in fact , this fal@@ se data of stu@@ x@@ net is already taken before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where , during the ch@@ ase , the sur@@ v@@ ei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce system is f@@ ed with previ@@ ous video foot@@ age .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea here , obviously , is not just che@@ cking the machine oper@@ ators in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
the idea is to over@@ look a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine oper@@ ator can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , when the big ste@@ am tur@@ bine becomes too fast , you have to open de@@ pos@@ it val@@ ves within milli@@ seconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and if they &apos;re at risk , bad things can happen .
the power plant can explo@@ de .
and not the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is gen@@ eric .
it has nothing to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with ur@@ ani@@ zation .
so for example , he would work just as well -- in a power station or in a car factory .
it &apos;s gener@@ ous .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to put the us@@ b data on a us@@ b stick , as we saw at stu@@ x@@ net .
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and when you do that , you end up with a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destru@@ ction .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence we have to imagine .
so unfortunately , the biggest target for those attac@@ ks is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most tar@@ ge@@ ting environ@@ ments .
we have to face the consequences , and we start to pre@@ p@@ are better .
thank you .
i have a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , a lot of it was repor@@ ted that people sus@@ pe@@ ct the mo@@ s@@ sad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opini@@ on ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind that is cyber@@ -@@ power .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for ch@@ as@@ ing us a married fear . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time are kind of dangerous .
i went to ja@@ il -- difficult .
i worked in a coal min@@ ing -- dangerous .
i fil@@ med in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i set out to be the biggest part of my career in terrible situations , and all of this for trying to do is to study social failure so that they are comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully in a way under@@ stand@@ able what makes them fun and acc@@ essi@@ ble to the audience .
so when i knew i was going to come here to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going to do something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that a few weeks ago i did an ad on e@@ bay .
i sent some facebook news , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to get nam@@ eless rights at my ted@@ talk 20@@ 11 .
really , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , got the un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it go again -- to buy nam@@ eless rights on the talk that you &apos;re seeing at that moment didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle or a lot of content or a lot .
so what you got was this : your name pres@@ ented here : my ted@@ talk you have no idea what the top@@ ic is going to be , and that could fly to your ears after content , especially if i &apos;m in charge of your company .
but bes@@ i@@ des that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people watch these ted@@ talks ?
a lot .
this is just the job ti@@ tles , by the way .
so despite that war@@ ning , i knew anybody would buy nam@@ eless rights .
now , if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certain@@ ty .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we &apos;re looking at the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing .
as i said , over the years , i enter@@ ed some pretty awful situations , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could up@@ set me to go to anything as difficult and as dangerous as these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film about plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the whole film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
and the film is called &quot; the record ever before . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the ever@@ -@@ time &quot; is that everything from above to bottom , everything from the beginning to the end , is totally covered with br@@ ands -- from the cover spon@@ sor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x@@ ke .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the state center ...
these people will be connected to the film in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , forever ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more to con@@ cre@@ te .
it was &quot; in per@@ pet@@ u@@ ity forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have brand x as a ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every categ@@ ory that &apos;s possible in the movie .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever wor@@ n ...
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the ever@@ -@@ time &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a sense of &quot; the time ever before . &quot;
so the idea is , bes@@ i@@ des showing that br@@ ands are a part of life , actually , get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of stat@@ s .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i &apos;d be happy if ce@@ g was going to help do that .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how powerful people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that has a negative not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to evol@@ ve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.@@ 5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth add@@ res@@ sing some really famous br@@ ands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a hor@@ ror people .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the film or a difficult thing to do for me ?
j@@ k : both .
... so , not so optimi@@ stic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what br@@ ands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
there are some places we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera out &quot; would mean we wanted to have a back@@ up conversation .
it turns out it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your movie . &quot;
and just so those companies disappe@@ ared , one by one .
no one wanted to do with the film .
i was ama@@ zed .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole idea of adverti@@ sing was to present your product to as many people as possible , let as many people see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , in this inter@@ section of new and old media and frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting medium tool that the mas@@ ses bring that message .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al error , and that was the following .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture represents is a problem .
see , if you type transpar@@ ency in google search , this is -- this is one of the first images that appe@@ ars .
i really like your species , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- fre@@ ely from de@@ ception and ba@@ g , just dete@@ ct and straight ; inst@@ antly under@@ stand@@ ably , characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility and access to information , especially in terms of business language -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transpar@@ ency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ os say it .
but when it gets there , it &apos;s supposed to be imple@@ mented , something changes .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like this strange bear , who still bre@@ e@@ ds .
it &apos;s un@@ predi@@ ctable -- like this strange road .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
a whole sh@@ ell cool food .
this is very ris@@ ky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , my father caught me lying -- and there he is , looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three ver@@ sions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but since only one company , an agen@@ cy has been willing to help us -- and it &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to go around the middle man and go directly with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive problem .
i have friends who make big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies , and i have friends who make small , t@@ one movies like me .
and my friends , who make great , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies , say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have .
and then my friends , who make little bat@@ h movies , say , &quot; well , how are we going to com@@ pe@@ te with these big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the record ever before . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see in the movie ?
whenever i get on my way , and whenever i open the medical dr@@ ank , you &apos;ll see de@@ ban de@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dun@@ es .
either fl@@ or@@ n fusion or par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equi@@ pped for both men and for women -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short so@@ cket .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you an ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te const@@ it@@ ution .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a challen@@ ger brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other br@@ ands .
so doing these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
in what words would you describe ban ?
ban is blan@@ k .
that &apos;s a great question .
ab@@ and@@ oned technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the bo@@ w@@ ls .
we talk about chicken , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really makes too positive , as op@@ posed to &quot; fight od@@ or and hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ company .
what about me ? what about print types ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , ot@@ to-@@ normal consum@@ ers .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clo@@ thing .
198@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val h@@ its sc@@ at@@ er@@ al points , except on fri@@ day .
all right , what &apos;s the brand ger@@ ry ?
unique .
i think the gen@@ re , the style i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gra@@ y colors and stuff .
but i usually have an acc@@ essi@@ ble like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and stuff like that .
if dan were a brand , he would probably be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des cab@@ rio .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , reli@@ able fly .
woman 2 : par@@ tly hi@@ pp@@ ie , part@@ s yo@@ g@@ i , par@@ tly bro@@ o@@ kl@@ y@@ n-@@ girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum guy .
i sell sch@@ ol@@ ars all over the country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i was an ex@@ pos@@ ure .
man 5 : brand failed al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ctive writing .
is that ?
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a stam@@ p .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom@@ -@@ brand , but i often see myself in the interface of dark glamour and ne@@ gle@@ ct fly .
and what i realized was that i needed an exper@@ t .
i needed someone who could inv@@ ade my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the brand@@ ing person@@ ality .
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ burg .
they have helped companies like ne@@ sts , fe@@ a@@ thers , hall@@ mark to discover this tra@@ de@@ mark person@@ ality .
if they could do it for them , they could certainly help me .
they brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people that shape my view of the world .
tell me about this world .
m@@ d : this world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and stuff .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me came and start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about why -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ p@@ pet sta@@ dium are they at now ?
why is it important to re@@ start ? what &apos;s the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what other met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ sis did they go through ?
... this doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster are you in ?
ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
thank you for your pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her brand person@@ ality separ@@ ated two , but it separ@@ ated full pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck@@ less brand is an ei@@ ght@@ ful one brand .
they do very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a streng@@ th , rather than both of them .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avo@@ i@@ ding things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and they &apos;re wel@@ come , and they actually turn them into something positive for themselves , and that &apos;s a la@@ y@@ ered move .
what other br@@ ands are doing ?
the first is a classi@@ c , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and jet@@ blue .
well , there &apos;s tra@@ cking br@@ ands and ei@@ ght@@ ful br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but one played , eight mar@@ ks is a pretty strong thing .
an ei@@ ght@@ ful , played brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would it be like ?
you &apos;re an up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that brings blood into wh@@ ales ?
or are they more like a down toll ?
are you something a little bit more cal@@ m , reser@@ va@@ tive , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , con@@ temporary , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , failed and lo@@ vely like er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , agi@@ le , gl@@ ori@@ ous , ma@@ gical and my@@ st@@ ical , like gand@@ al@@ f .
or are they more like a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
are you min@@ d@@ ful and mon@@ um@@ n like 00@@ 7 ?
are they establi@@ shed , tradition@@ ally , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ?
are you reli@@ able , stable , family , safe , na@@ tive , sac@@ red , consi@@ der@@ able and wise like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film , we had over 500 companies that were up and down companies and they said no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything to that movie because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but they found 17 brand partners who were willing to give attention to this control that would do business with somebody as care and act as i did , and who would finally en@@ able us to tell stories that we wouldn &apos;t have normally been able to do -- stories that a ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ er would never be suppor@@ ted .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that today you use mr@@ i to p@@ in the air centers of the brain to make both adverti@@ sing and films .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o where out@@ door adverti@@ sing had been ban@@ ned .
all over the city , there has been no ti@@ mel@@ ine , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing for five years .
and we dro@@ ve in school distri@@ cts where companies were tra@@ cking their way into im@@ pover@@ ished schools across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i got the biggest success , those are where i inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands have done .
because they went to the middle man , they went around the agen@@ cies , and they said that maybe the agen@@ cies don &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our world is challen@@ ging .
and what did that do for you ? what did it succe@@ ed ?
well , since the film had pre@@ mi@@ ered at the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , we can look at that .
according to bur@@ r@@ elle , the pre@@ mi@@ ere one in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this movie .
this actually inclu@@ des just a two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half weeks &apos; period .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been deli@@ vered yet .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no stre@@ aming online .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
well , finally , the film has ga@@ ined a very large moment@@ um .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad agen@@ cy we talked to has re@@ com@@ men@@ ded its custom@@ er to let the fing@@ ers go .
one of the things that i fir@@ m@@ ly believe is that when you take your chance , you take risks , you get these risks .
i think if you keep people from doing it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you pre@@ p@@ are the whole company to gain profit .
i feel like as people move forward , we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be sc@@ ared of opportunities they might sc@@ are .
finally , when we move forward , we should wel@@ come the fear .
we should put the bear in the c@@ age .
wel@@ come the fear . wel@@ come the risk .
a big spo@@ on full , this is how we wel@@ come the risk .
and finally , let &apos;s wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of hon@@ est@@ y brings us very far .
and that was said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency , &quot; was pres@@ ented to you by my good friends of em@@ c , who paid 7@@ 100 dollars for the name rights on e@@ bay .
big data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world into great opportunities .
em@@ c pres@@ ents &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency this : what happened to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i did a check in my po@@ cket , put it on the top of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check up at 7@@ 100 dollars to fund my ted next year .
my name is am@@ it .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i talked about doing something with muse@@ ums and art , and my che@@ f@@ in , which is also today , gave me a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , at 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on leadership .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many muse@@ ums and those art@@ works .
so when i was traveling and vis@@ iting these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire -- make art more acc@@ essi@@ ble -- to bring technology together .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since we started .
so you just go to google proje@@ ct@@ .@@ com@@ .
you can look around in all these muse@@ ums here .
there &apos;s u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ k , the van go@@ gh .
i even come to one of my favorite ones , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click , and w@@ um@@ ms , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you walk around and you am@@ use yourself .
you want to ori@@ ent in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in it , they want to go to the end of the gang .
just further . lots of fun .
clean it up .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , t@@ ar workers of bee@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel in the met .
i see this pl@@ uses .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click that now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been stuck with the so@@ -@@ called gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion points of ima@@ gery , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can zo@@ om in very easily and out .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i got up close , and i realized slowly these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , spoke to some familiar met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ a@@ il , where a whole day is be@@ aten with a stick on the fa@@ st-@@ day basis .
it seemed quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned a little bit about it .
to get really close , you can go to your cra@@ cks .
just to give you the over@@ view , i zo@@ om out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump to mom@@ a quickly , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
the previ@@ ous example was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the stro@@ kes of the paint@@ br@@ ush ?
and what only if you want to see van go@@ gh creating this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om in on one of my favorite cli@@ mbers of this picture until i &apos;m really in the cra@@ cks .
this is star@@ ring night , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many others , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
all of you , everyone -- if you have rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- don &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- out of all these pictures , you can put your own colle@@ ction .
very simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om around .
this is &quot; the ab@@ and@@ oned , &quot; in the national stal@@ aller@@ y .
you can miss everything with sugge@@ sti@@ ons , send your friends , and such a conversation about what you feel when you look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
i think finally , to me , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the muse@@ ums , i think .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to talk to this digital medium of art , and represent it proper@@ ly online .
and the biggest question i get asked recently is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it should fill the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be divi@@ ded into two hal@@ ves .
this is the left half that &apos;s the lo@@ gical side and then the right half that &apos;s the intui@@ tive side .
if we had a measure of the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ des of each he@@ mis@@ p@@ here , we could represent their brain .
for example , would this be somebody who is completely lo@@ gical .
this would be somebody who is completely intui@@ tive .
now , where would you position your brain at that scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te that is also in both he@@ mis@@ p@@ here .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive or whatever .
they can be lo@@ gical and intui@@ tive .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experiment@@ al quantum physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good percentage of lo@@ gic to bring together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually ex@@ ec@@ ute experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then see how it respon@@ ds , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically they do the same thing .
so one of the intui@@ tions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that at the same time a thing can be just in one place .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea ; they designed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a floor th@@ res@@ hold .
he was another to@@ dd@@ ler , and not very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing .
but i bet that playing with the th@@ res@@ hold taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that the big stuff doesn &apos;t just leave you over , and that it sta@@ ys in a place .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with soil vi@@ bra@@ tions , but they &apos;re playing with these little strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover all kinds of weird things -- like they fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called the theory of quantum mechan@@ ics .
this was the physics of a few years ago ; it took quantum mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but it didn &apos;t take them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play with particles that often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a partic@@ le .
but my lo@@ gical side didn &apos;t like it either .
because if all these things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t all be the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i &apos;d feel better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics .
so a few years ago , i set out to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
here , i &apos;ll exp@@ and it a little bit . we &apos;re looking right here at the center .
and here &apos;s a really big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal sha@@ ped like a spr@@ ing@@ board , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new si@@ li@@ con@@ s , and i ra@@ cked on all the big devices for 100 hours .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of swi@@ mming po@@ ol and this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analo@@ gy .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full el@@ ev@@ ator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i stop doing all these things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them with it , or , frank@@ ly , they disappe@@ ar .
so quantum mechan@@ ics says that un@@ mov@@ able objects feel the same way .
the co-@@ dri@@ vers for in@@ tra@@ ctable objects are not just people , but the light that sh@@ ines on them and the wind that &apos;s s@@ wee@@ ping on them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal was changing quantum mechan@@ ically , we had to k@@ ick all the mit@@ es out .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and su@@ cked all the air and cool@@ ed it up until almost now on the el@@ ev@@ ator alone , the piece of metal was free to act like it wanted .
so we measu@@ red its movement .
we found that it was moving really strange .
instead of just being quiet there , it was vi@@ br@@ ating . the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was something like this -- like a exp@@ and@@ ing and blo@@ wing bubble bal@@ g .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vi@@ bra@@ te it at the same time and not vi@@ bra@@ te it -- something that only allowed in quantum mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;m telling you right now is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time to vi@@ bra@@ te and not to vi@@ bra@@ te ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down .
just for pre@@ cise times they agree .
for the rest of the time , they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om at the same time is in two different places , which at the same time means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth sle@@ eping for all this year in the clean room , because , you know , the difference between a single at@@ om and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why can &apos;t it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my lo@@ gical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re in many places at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct of history .
when we warm it up and turned the lights on and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just ag@@ oni@@ zed objects that are made together in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechan@@ ics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more of that . it &apos;s even deeper .
it turns out that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the profound and strange of quantum mechan@@ ics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , they want to be able to choose between at least one hand of different cities all in competition to new resi@@ dents .
we are right now far from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who are not even available a single city that would wel@@ come them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than they &apos;re co@@ sting them .
so we could very easily deal with the world , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for you , so you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just swa@@ p out the construction of a@@ part@@ ments against cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments did this already ; the other half don &apos;t .
they could try to exp@@ and the capacity of exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
but you know what they would be willing to engage in these a@@ part@@ ments and their environment to avoid com@@ pla@@ ining and to di@@ stra@@ ct from building .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to understand all these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new block of h@@ ous@@ ing , predi@@ cted the laws there would support such a construction and not prevent it .
so i pro@@ posed that governments can create new sur@@ faces that will provide enough space for a city and give you a name : char@@ ter cities .
i later discovered that , roughly the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to en@@ sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at this point , ja@@ four said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens if we take a blan@@ k area of our country -- what if we just gave them a message of the american em@@ bas@@ sy -- some of the can@@ adi@@ an bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cks -- and if people want to go to work under the united states or the can@@ adi@@ an e@@ craft ?
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered from a profound dec@@ lar@@ ation crisis .
in the next plan@@ ned elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a tur@@ n@@ around whose program was both new and also dis@@ pu@@ ting .
he dem@@ and@@ ed oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his stable .
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a talk at ted@@ global .
through impro@@ vement , try and use it through the study of consum@@ ers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the fundamental elements .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that deter@@ mine already exi@@ sting h@@ ous@@ ing ow@@ ners cannot be dist@@ ur@@ bed .
we give new technologies great attention , but for progress it takes technologies and laws , and it &apos;s common laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk .
again , he showed him ja@@ four .
they called me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in dec@@ ember in a hot@@ els sitting in mi@@ ami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they are at cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york , and remember that in some cases a surface is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstra@@ ct discus@@ sion at a point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk repres@@ ented in very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place whose early un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited country is a fo@@ unding contra@@ ct that determin@@ es the laws that are there , and people are willing to choose to live either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who meant we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is to move forward .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and give a le@@ cture on the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary .
so i gave another filled talk with facts that inclu@@ ded a graph like this that tries to show that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch represents the new air@@ port built in den@@ ver .
this air@@ port alone has a area of 100 square kilometers .
so i tried to convince hon@@ dur@@ ans if you want to build a new city , you have to start an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s over 250 thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
poli@@ tely , everybody appl@@ au@@ ded .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
the dire@@ ctor of the con@@ gress came on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and i came to the core stat@@ ement that a new city off@@ ers new opportunities to people .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as instead of hundreds of kilometers away in the north .
and a new city inclu@@ des new possibilities for leaders as well .
the leaders of the government in hon@@ dur@@ as would dep@@ end on the help of partner@@ ship countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that would help them set up the laws for this char@@ ter and the per@@ mission that anyone could really trust that the char@@ ter would be imple@@ mented .
and the reali@@ zation of president lo@@ bo was that the certain@@ ty of the trans@@ lation that i thought about could be one way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come and build this city equ@@ ally relevant for all the par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as that have been under fear and di@@ str@@ ust for many years .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it cap@@ tures a thousand square kilometers .
and shor@@ tly after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed con@@ gress for a change in const@@ it@@ ution to have a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive policy that is reli@@ able for special development areas .
in a country that has just been ele@@ cted to a massive crisis in con@@ gress for this change in 1@@ 24 to a voice .
all par@@ ties , all the questions in society , suppor@@ ted this .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ ved twice by con@@ gress .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th , the second time it was appro@@ ved with 1@@ 14 to a voice .
immediately after that ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st and febru@@ ary 24@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 fam@@ ans travel@@ ed to the two places in the world that were most interested in ris@@ ing into the business of the city .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center built in south korea , big than the city of bo@@ st@@ ons .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the appro@@ val .
the other place that was very interested in building cities is sing@@ apo@@ re .
there have already been two cities built in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a piece of construction , and they already mention this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been worked on a legal system that mana@@ gers are allowed to participa@@ te , and it &apos;s also worked on an ex@@ ternal legal system .
a country has already off@@ ered its su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t to be a cour@@ t for the ab@@ und@@ ant job of the legal system in the cour@@ t .
also , urban designers and construction are very interested .
they even bring money into it .
one thing , as you know , has already been resol@@ ved , there are many ten@@ ants .
there are a lot of oper@@ ations that would love to look at in america , especially in a place with a free zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who say they want to live perman@@ ently in a different place .
a million people are leaving la@@ tin america every year and migr@@ ating to the united states .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families back to find work -- sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clo@@ th@@ es .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who &apos;ve been trying to find their parents again that they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen their parents for a decade .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about building a whole new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ?
or even building stupid of these cities , or giving out hundreds of them all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between multiple cities in competition around new resi@@ dents ?
that &apos;s an idea worth spre@@ ading .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as have asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that makes a typical american person a day is 7@@ 0@@ th .
and also , a recent study of ce@@ os where they saw ce@@ os for a week .
and these scientists have just docum@@ ented the different issues that these ce@@ o is doing , and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ce@@ o is dealing with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks a week .
each of these top@@ ics , of course , was made of many , many smaller decisions .
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions do you make in the nine minutes of categ@@ ory versus those in an hour &apos;s categ@@ ory ?
how good do you think are you in dealing with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making problems of our modern time , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some of the possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hand , because i &apos;m blind , only if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the over@@ load problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very ex@@ clu@@ sive gro@@ cer@@ y store , at least at the time he was really ex@@ clu@@ sive .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure sav@@ ings .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and essi@@ g and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tab@@ les and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and this was at a time when we actually dr@@ un@@ k water .
i loved going to this business , but at one point i wonder@@ ed , well , how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil going .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those who were em@@ bed@@ ded in bo@@ xes that came from thousands of year-old o@@ live trees .
so one day i decided to go to the box box , and i asked the la@@ d@@ der , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he poin@@ ted at the bus@@ es of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day and used to have their camer@@ as .
we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mar@@ ker gang .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
we set up a little co@@ operation right at the ent@@ r@@ ance of business .
we put six different fla@@ vor dire@@ ctions of mar@@ mel@@ ade or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of mar@@ mel@@ ade , and we looked at two things : first of all , what case would i be more people standing and trying mar@@ mel@@ ade ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent , than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what case people were more likely to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
of the people who sta@@ yed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
of the people who sta@@ yed when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , when you calcu@@ late it , people bought six times more of a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade who you had six choices than if you had 24 choices .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ line -- but it turns out that decisi@@ on-@@ making problems also affect us in very sequen@@ cing decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our own best interest@@ s .
so on the subject of the day , financial saving .
now i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ myself kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang , where we looked at the decisions of sav@@ ings plans for the reti@@ re@@ ment of almost one million americans of about 6@@ 50 plans all over the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ s@@ ans that were possible for a reti@@ re@@ ment plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , affe@@ cts the prob@@ ability of saving more tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a relationship .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that allowed people to do anything between two to 5@@ 9 different f@@ on@@ ds .
and what we found was that the more fund was off@@ ered , in fact , the less part of the story .
now , if you look at the extre@@ mes , the plans that were off@@ ering two f@@ on@@ ds , they had a se@@ vent@@ h rate in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that off@@ ered almost 60 f@@ on@@ ds , the participa@@ tion rate now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0s percent .
now it turns out that even if you &apos;re un@@ lo@@ cked , when there &apos;s more choices to choose , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participa@@ te tend to have more opportunities available to them , the more they r@@ ented it into action and fund .
the more opportunities they had , the more they put all their money into pure money .
none of these extreme decisions , are part of the decisions someone would re@@ com@@ mend if their future financial wel@@ f@@ are is important to us .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences in humans that offer more and more choices to themselves .
they sho@@ ot the decision -- push it up , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they make more bad decisions -- worse financial and worse medical choices .
they choose more for things they make less satis@@ fied themselves , even if they make it obje@@ ctive better .
the main reason for this is that perhaps we enjoy looking at these huge shel@@ ves of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , essi@@ g and mar@@ mel@@ ade , but in fact we can &apos;t compare and bor@@ der and then actually choose something from the fantastic bot .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in different ways and different research places -- that they can just apply in their business .
first , nar@@ row .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today that less is more .
people are always dist@@ ur@@ bed when i say , &quot; nar@@ row . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing space .
but in fact , we see it ever more and more that if you &apos;re willing to nar@@ row , and the un@@ important equal possibilities get rid of , well , there &apos;s a increase in sal@@ es , the cost is brought down , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an impro@@ vement in the perception .
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble redu@@ ced the different head and the different types of head to 15 , they experienced a increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
when the gol@@ den cat corpo@@ ration got rid of her 10 best selling kat@@ zen@@ stre@@ us , they experienced that the ga@@ ins went up at 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of both sal@@ es and redu@@ cing cost .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ t today off@@ ers 4@@ 5,000 products .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art off@@ ers you 100,000 products today .
but the ne@@ ar-@@ largest super@@ market in the world today is al@@ di , and they only offer you 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ ses .
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the best examples that recently came out of the market is how best you man@@ date the choices was something that david la@@ ib@@ son has done very well , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s being off@@ ered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now auto@@ matically participa@@ te in a life@@ times fund .
those who really want to make a choice are off@@ ered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to nar@@ row it .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the question is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t keep them apart , their custom@@ ers can &apos;t . &quot;
now before we started this after@@ no@@ on , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer a single vac@@ ation to the most beautiful street in this audience .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
and i want to read them to you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read it , and then i &apos;ll ask you to cla@@ p it if you &apos;re ready to embra@@ ce g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
okay . anyone who &apos;s ready to accept g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
are they all ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you saw obje@@ ctively , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would like to guess you &apos;d feel it more real than the second time you got it .
because the pictures made it real feeling for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps them deal with the problem of over@@ load decisi@@ on-@@ making , which is con@@ cre@@ te .
it &apos;s about people , in order to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what the consequences are associated with individual possibilities , and that these consequences have to be vi@@ dly and con@@ cre@@ te .
why do people on average spend 15 to 30 percent more if they use a ec@@ -@@ map or a credit card than bar@@ money ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like we &apos;re paying .
and it turns out that if you manage something to feel con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we did a study i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o fel@@ ter@@ o , and we did a study with the people at ing -- employees who worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gather@@ ing where they had their participa@@ tion .
and during that gather@@ ing , we in@@ her@@ ited this meeting just as it used to be , we ad@@ ded a little thing to it .
the small thing that we ad@@ ded was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a 20 percent increase in participa@@ tion , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save or an increase in four percent by the amount they were willing to pay for the sav@@ ings account .
third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can deal with more categ@@ ories than more choices .
for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine gang .
it turns out that in the away man@@ s super@@ markets up and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , the number of 3@@ 1 different pa@@ pers vari@@ ed from high to 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and put them into 10 categ@@ ories or i &apos;m showing you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , and i &apos;m going to spli@@ t them into 20 categ@@ ories , you think i &apos;ve given them more choices and a better sele@@ ction experience than i would give you the 400 other than i had given them the 600 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to hold them apart .
here are two different s@@ mu@@ d@@ ges .
one is called ja@@ z@@ z , and the other is called s@@ wing .
if you think the left display is s@@ wing , and the ad on the right is ja@@ z@@ z , you cla@@ p your hands .
okay , there are a few .
if you think that &apos;s ja@@ z@@ z on the left , and that , on the right side , is s@@ wing , please cla@@ p .
okay , a few more .
well it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ z@@ z , and on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly un@@ useful categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me .
the categ@@ ories have to tell the sele@@ ctor something , not to provide the choice .
and this is a problem that you often see when you look at the long li@@ sts of all these fund .
who do you actually want to in@@ form with it ?
my fourth techni@@ que : predi@@ cting complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we just have to simpli@@ fy it .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ ch@@ ase of a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that off@@ ers you the ability to con@@ figure your car completely itself .
you have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to completely design your car .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices they provide per decision .
car color , foreign color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 op@@ tions .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ars -- four possibilities .
now what i do is i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half the custom@@ ers go from the many possibilities of 5@@ 6 car colors to the low possibilities , four ge@@ ars .
the other half of the custom@@ ers go from the low possibilities , four ge@@ ars , to the 5@@ 6 car colors , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice for choice , it means you &apos;re over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , the hot@@ test , i &apos;m losing it .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who go from many to low prob@@ ability d@@ ough over and over again choose standard choice .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then you stay there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is pres@@ ented .
when i start with the simple one , i learn how to choose .
even though the ge@@ ar is sele@@ cting me , nothing about my pre@@ fer@@ ences at inter@@ ior equipment , it &apos;s still prepar@@ ing me to choose .
it also exc@@ ites me about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m ready to motiv@@ ate myself to be interested in this .
let me wra@@ p up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are mil@@ king the problem of decision over@@ load -- limited -- are the ob@@ so@@ le@@ te alterna@@ tives , con@@ cre@@ te -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ zing -- we can hand@@ le better categ@@ ories , less opportunities ; we can address complexity .
each of these techniques that i describe to you today is thought to help you manage the possibility -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that if you choose , you &apos;re sele@@ ctive .
and the more we choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca , tr@@ end@@ s-@@ mana@@ gers on youtube , and i look at youtube videos for a living .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video becomes vi@@ ral , and then finally , why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ itely difficult .
but web@@ videos have allowed us all , or all of our creative activi@@ ties , to be terri@@ bly famous in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet until next satur@@ day .
but youtube is u@@ plo@@ aded over 4@@ 8 hours of video per minute .
it &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever becoming vi@@ ral and is looked at thousands of times and such a cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , se@@ am@@ mates and the un@@ expected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
who@@ a !
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , vas@@ que@@ z sent this video that he had fil@@ med before his house in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the last summer .
in fact , never really wanted to make a vi@@ ral video .
he just wanted to share one rain@@ bow .
because this is what you do when you call yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain mes@@ h .
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually already sent in janu@@ ary .
what happened here ?
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel sent the t@@ we@@ et who ended up making the video so popular .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker , like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel , imagine new and interesting things and show a big audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day . fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day everybody . &apos; will@@ ing@@ ness to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day . fri@@ day . ge@@ tin down fri@@ day . you didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks is one of the most popular video of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the ch@@ art looked like .
just like the &quot; double rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to have come out of no@@ where .
what happened that day ?
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other pe@@ a@@ ks are also fri@@ days .
but what about that day , that particular fri@@ day ?
well , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 put it on , lots of blogs started writing about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from the my@@ th theater was a first person to twitter about it .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ maker took a stand@@ point , shared with a large audience , acceler@@ ated the process .
and then this community of people who shared this big joke and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ di@@ as of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single day in the first seven days .
unlike the one-@@ way entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the community &apos;s participa@@ tion is to become our way of becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or doing something new from it .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an cat &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ less loo@@ p .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it &apos;s been looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version of it that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cat@@ s look at this video .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s looking at this video .
what &apos;s important is that creativity is domin@@ ated in the internet culture of technology and ge@@ e@@ ks .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
and then it became international .
an entire re@@ mi@@ x community shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something we can all participa@@ te in .
today , we don &apos;t just find enjo@@ y@@ ment of something , we do .
who could have looked forward to all this ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bow &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an cat ? &quot;
what are the scri@@ p@@ ts that you can write where this is supposed to be ?
in a world where every minute there &apos;s two days of video being u@@ plo@@ aded , only really unique and un@@ expected can emer@@ ge as the videos i mentioned .
i ad@@ mit , i was not particularly interested when a friend said to myself , i should look at this great video , about a guy prote@@ sting in new york against ti@@ ckets for bi@@ cy@@ cles .
i got a ti@@ cket because i didn &apos;t drive on the bi@@ ke path , but often there are dis@@ abilities that don &apos;t let you drive on the bi@@ ke path .
since this was completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ ats were vie@@ wed funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true of anything new that we do creative .
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
what does that mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative partici@@ pants , completely un@@ expected , are the characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and determin@@ es the audience more popular .
as i said , one of the greatest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did his beginning on youtube .
nobody has to give their ideas green light .
and today we all feel ourselves as ow@@ ners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteri@@ stics of old media , and they &apos;re also har@@ dly hit@@ ting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connection between women about three generations in 10 minutes , and how the ast@@ on@@ ishing streng@@ th of this conne@@ c@@ te@@ dness mani@@ fest itself in the lives of a four@@ -year-old girl &apos;s life , than she was living in a small sister , her mother and her grandmother , five days and ni@@ ghts ago , and a little girl in a bo@@ w@@ l .
history is not over yet .
she &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his life .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of it as a mar@@ ch of communication in sa@@ ig@@ on , as it must say , his life has been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , now his friends spo@@ ken .
he re@@ moved to sil@@ ence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that history was trying to cr@@ ush us , but we were missing it .
the next puzz@@ le piece shows how a boat is running in the early morning morning l@@ ens at sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ gu@@ ed marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , life had asked her a question : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was totally ex@@ clu@@ ded that she could fail .
after a four@@ -year-old and film ru@@ b@@ ber sa@@ ga gli@@ tt , a boat still tar@@ ge@@ ted as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
they were terri@@ fied of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was carrying a little po@@ ison bottle .
in a pris@@ on@@ er , my sister and i had only dr@@ un@@ k her and my grandmother from her .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the cla@@ pping of every wave on the bu@@ g , the long and empty hori@@ zon .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came in many times , but went from the death coura@@ ge of the men on our boat or the inci@@ dence of the engine who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil sp@@ ill off the mal@@ a@@ y@@ an coast , and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever ta@@ sted like this again .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we ended up in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of puzz@@ le is about four women in three generations who together build a new life .
we sett@@ led down in foot@@ sc@@ ray , one of the working class in@@ hab@@ ited sub@@ ur@@ bs whose population is made out of im@@ migr@@ ant la@@ yers .
unlike the out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ box sub@@ ur@@ bs that had been completely un@@ known to me , there was no challenge in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
the fra@@ me@@ work from the tru@@ cks came from the rest of the world .
and the f@@ at@@ ty of english was exchange between people who had one thing in common : they started again .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a assem@@ bly line in a car factory , six days , double la@@ yers .
she somehow managed to find her time to get english and it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
we were poor .
every dollar was divi@@ ded and put into more education for english and mathematics no matter what we had to deal with , and most of the time the new things that came from second hand .
two stre@@ t@@ ches for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form up to the cra@@ cks , because it had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful ch@@ au@@ stri@@ es of &quot; na@@ sty eye &quot; and there and there are ta@@ pe@@ stri@@ es : &quot; asi@@ ans , go home . &quot;
home where ?
something went up to me .
there was a meeting about re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get you out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we listen@@ ed to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suff@@ ered from the boat in ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake every night until their ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came up so i could wake them up .
she opened up a computer business , then made a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic education and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t make change , an@@ gry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and car@@ ed children , caught between two worl@@ ds .
lo@@ ans and spon@@ s@@ ors were se@@ arch@@ ed .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worl@@ ds .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student who hi@@ red in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble dem@@ ands on himself .
in the other hand , i was wra@@ pped in un@@ certain lives , wor@@ e the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , of drug ab@@ use and insu@@ lation .
but so many got help over the years .
and because of that help , i was mentioned in my last year of law school as a young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one puzz@@ le piece to the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ture , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anony@@ mous user of foot@@ sc@@ ray , was now tan le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , who was invited to speak to places she &apos;d never heard of , and d@@ well@@ ings whose existence she could never have imag@@ ined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ ck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about w@@ ine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the r@@ out@@ ine and the conven@@ i@@ ence of life of an un@@ known ance@@ st@@ or -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who were as closed as they were for 20 years by telling and sle@@ eping each other the stories of their day , we still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she remin@@ ded me that now i was as old as they did when we ste@@ pped the boat .
no , there was no way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ y and education , and the ne@@ gle@@ ct of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all living systems , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limit@@ s of the possible .
and although i gradu@@ ated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t take a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there had to be another puzz@@ le piece .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a no@@ vel@@ ty , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something to be gr@@ ate@@ ful for , perhaps a gift of the boat .
because bel@@ on@@ ging can lead so easily to the collap@@ se of the hori@@ zon can mean so easily you accept the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
i &apos;ve now gone from my conven@@ i@@ ence to know that , yes , the world brea@@ ks apart , but not the way you fear it .
possibilities that were not allowed were ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly encoura@@ ged .
there was a energy , an in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and wa@@ g@@ ging .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i colle@@ cted a small team of people around me , for the sho@@ e bla@@ de , &quot; not &quot; an in@@ consi@@ stent challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of every day , i coo@@ ked a huge top sou@@ p that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant people in it , and we made the break@@ through .
i made a decision to move to the united states .
after just one journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the ad@@ venture continued .
before i close this talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her own .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
without her husband &apos;s support , she worried for a conversation by bringing him to cour@@ t and cla@@ im in her own case , and a greater conversation than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; pro@@ ved to be un@@ true .
i was just sho@@ ot@@ ing in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney when she died , 1,000 kilometers away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i looked through the sho@@ wer wall and saw it standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goo@@ d@@ b@@ ye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her sar@@ g .
we told her stories and made her make sure we were still with her .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and said he had to close the sar@@ g .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been keeping them this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through women .
you see who we were and how life sha@@ ped us now we can see that the men who might have come into our lives would have come into us .
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ lege , of e@@ ase , of coun@@ sel@@ ing .
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life that car@@ es b@@ old every wave that dri@@ ves un@@ bit@@ ing , ste@@ ad@@ y tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the large hori@@ zon that doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that and sur@@ ely get it through , i would .
also , t@@ ans &apos;s mother is in the fourth or fif@@ th row here today .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with you .
is it photograph@@ y at all ?
because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y began when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
i combin@@ ed it with my earlier pre@@ ference for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera , the process was actually in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you put it on the tri@@ g@@ gers .
so for me , photograph@@ y seemed to be more about going in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the tri@@ g@@ ger is expres@@ sed .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much road .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and still , still , a reali@@ stic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a reali@@ stic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo@@ -@@ reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i always want to make it look like you could have done that in a picture .
photographs where you have to think for a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about cat@@ ching an idea than really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes perspective is an illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how it can be tan@@ gi@@ ble in a two-@@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not what &apos;s reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
so i think the bas@@ ics are very simple .
i see them as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects that we all relate to in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three dimensions like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we are missing our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combin@@ ing photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make a picture look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , things around us in our everyday lives .
but when we com@@ bine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but they can com@@ bine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed pictures should have the same perspective .
secon@@ dly , to have combin@@ ed pictures of the same ligh@@ ting type .
and these two pictures meet these two dem@@ ands -- shot out of the same al@@ titude and the same ligh@@ ting type .
three is about making it impossible to tell where the individual images begin and end by conne@@ cting se@@ am@@ less@@ ly .
make it impossible to say how this photograph was actually put together .
so by compar@@ ing color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness to the ed@@ ges of individual images , photograph@@ er ble@@ mis@@ hes combin@@ ed like ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner , de@@ lic@@ ate colors and dis@@ orders , we will wi@@ pe the boun@@ dar@@ ies between the different images and make them look like a single photograph , although a picture can basically con@@ tain hundreds of the size of it .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was mani@@ pul@@ ated .
but this picture is actually completely com@@ posed of photographs of different places .
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to com@@ promise with ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan it , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
for example , the fish had been taken on a smo@@ oth trip .
the bank is from another place .
the under@@ water part comes from a quar@@ ry .
and yes , i even rever@@ se the house up on the island of red to make it look swe@@ dis@@ h .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it &apos;s going beyond me to design .
i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the various images .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well-@@ plan@@ ned .
and when you do good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that li@@ mi@@ cs us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail .
and i think the most important point about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the ra@@ d@@ b@@ ou@@ d university was to set up a major listen@@ er .
and she doesn &apos;t do it very scienti@@ fically -- she puts a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a and as@@ ks the patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how &apos;s it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think this is one of the main problems why everyone -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects are missing : because we stopped listening .
this is my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ age . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a butt@@ on / off .
and every morning i jum@@ ped on it .
and yeah , i have a problem , as you might recognize .
i did my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simply : every time i jump on the scale , it sen@@ ds my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also called up by my general doctor so that he can see where my weight problem is , and that &apos;s not just where i need car@@ di@@ ological support or whatever , but also with a view of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you may know , i have over 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
so every morning i jum@@ ped on my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ age , and people are talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ a . &quot;
but this is the ni@@ c@@ est thing that can happen because this is the pe@@ er co@@ er@@ ci@@ on , group forced to help patients , because this could be used against o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could take patients off smo@@ king .
it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs , and get them to play some kind of game together to control their health better .
the next week , this is coming to the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little blood pressure measu@@ re@@ ment device that you atta@@ ch to an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send them to their doctor and share it with others , for example , more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in , and not only can they take control , be cap@@ tain on their own ship , but can help us face the challenges that are ahead of us , and the free explosion of health care , double demand , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use and start embra@@ cing patients on the team .
and they can do that through these sorts of ways , but also crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you a short video .
we have all the navi@@ gation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the at@@ m machines are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
we know another one where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
and sure , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would the next a@@ ed be to help this patient ?
we asked about it , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where to find the next life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed at that moment .
so what did we do ? we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we built a website and asked a crow@@ d , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please tell us where it is when it &apos;s up , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during business , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds have already been repor@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
the next step was to find the app@@ s for this .
and we made an i@@ pad ap@@ p .
we developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exten@@ ded reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and also in the next weeks your micro@@ software cell phone to find the next a@@ ed that can save your life .
and by now , we want to do this not just as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , what the product is called an a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we want to get this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us be@@ have like k@@ not points to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds all over the world .
and if you &apos;re on vac@@ ation and somebody collap@@ ses , whether you &apos;re your own rela@@ tives or somebody else , you can find an a@@ ed like this .
the other thing we want to ask for is that companies around the world help us ac@@ knowledge these a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be od@@ d services , for example , or techni@@ cians , just to make sure that the mel@@ ted a@@ ed is still in its place .
please help us improve health not just a little bit , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i work in solar technology .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to make an environ@@ ment@@ alist protection by ...
... crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing is paying attention .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it might take a while it &apos;s invited .
now -- we can just jump over -- i &apos;ll just jump over the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much what they actually hate , we &apos;ve made them work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s kind of like the pe@@ ac@@ e@@ kee@@ pers for computer fre@@ a@@ ks .
we choose some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we let them work with city admini@@ stra@@ tions .
instead of sen@@ ding them into the third world , we &apos;re sen@@ ding them into city users .
and they developed great app@@ s , worked with urban collabor@@ ators .
but what they really do is show what technology is possible today .
so you meet al .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s free@@ zing him when he &apos;s scre@@ en@@ ed because he knows he &apos;s not very good at brand@@ ing when he &apos;s covered by a meter s@@ now .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year in the train of the code for america .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and there was a lot of work going on last febru@@ ary .
and they realized that the city never rele@@ ases these hy@@ dr@@ ant .
but a particular fellow , a man named eri@@ k michael &apos;s ob@@ ese , noticed something else , and that was that resi@@ dents were fre@@ e-@@ rais@@ ing the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these parts .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant .
you agree with him fre@@ ely when he s@@ ells .
if you do that , you can name it , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a mo@@ dest little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s written by the fel@@ lo@@ ws last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s rapi@@ dly spre@@ ading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who saw that he could use these ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but for the citizens to adop@@ t ts@@ un@@ ic@@ i si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these ts@@ un@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ teri@@ es .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then se@@ att@@ le decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean the clo@@ g@@ ged gul@@ l@@ ys .
and chicago just introduced them to get people out of the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy when it &apos;s fast .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use these ap@@ p .
and it &apos;s spread ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h , organic , of course .
when you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work that way .
the fund@@ ing of software usually takes a few years .
we had a team working on a project last year in boston that took three and a half months to do this .
it was about a method where parents can figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were told later that if it had been about the normal can@@ als , it would have taken over two years and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
there &apos;s a project right now in california justice that &apos;s cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of the government .
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spre@@ ads from sel@@ s is kind of a shot before the bu@@ g on the institution of the government .
it shows how government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think it should work .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , at this ap@@ p , it represents a new generation that attac@@ ks the problem of government -- not as the problem of a so@@ unded institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to effectively t@@ ack@@ le things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country writing up and writing government app@@ s every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with it , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it , they re@@ pair it .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost out of their eyes .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about is government , at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we can &apos;t do together alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people ab@@ and@@ oned the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is changing .
and because the government ultimately ex@@ hau@@ sts its power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought the government was mostly about pi@@ cking people into office .
now after two years , i came to the conclu@@ sion that it &apos;s all about m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ al rat@@ s .
this is the call center for service and information .
that &apos;s where you usually get out if you &apos;re calling in your city 3@@ 11 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man , as part of the program -- in fact , they all do this -- you &apos;ll see that people calling the government for many different problems , including a rat .
so scot@@ t gets this ferti@@ li@@ zer .
he type &quot; th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal beginn@@ er .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house and play very l@@ oud music and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock is skin ? &quot;
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al rat@@ s .
it &apos;s not just a call center in boston .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and cell ap@@ p , called citizens connect .
we didn &apos;t write the ap@@ p .
this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
one day -- this is a actual report -- this came in : &quot; mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al rat in my tr@@ ash bin . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
scot@@ t talked from human to human .
but on &quot; citizens connect , &quot; it &apos;s all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighb@@ or .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the tr@@ ash ton behind the house .
mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al rat@@ s ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
turned the tr@@ ash ton on the page . went home .
good night , swe@@ et mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al rat@@ s . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to crow@@ d@@ source the government .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but the government here played a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have jo@@ ined them with government services if they had been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a much better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
if one night helps the other , we streng@@ then our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal beginn@@ er , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things we need to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s one in@@ put of the other .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is to vote .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we re@@ c@@ line and we expect the government to refle@@ ct our values and our needs , and then we don &apos;t change much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15 in@@ ches .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and we use that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ lation that this thing that we own , for which we pay , makes something work against us , something else , and then we de@@ constru@@ ct ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to do bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
because this is where the actual government work is happening .
we have to rely on the government machine .
so the occu@@ py@@ thes@@ ia movement did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of trou@@ bled citizens who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s an answer to the se@@ c me@@ mo about the financial re@@ form .
this is not poli@@ tically active , this is bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic .
now , for those of us who &apos;ve given up the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
do we really believe that we do what we need to do without impro@@ ving an institution that can act on be@@ half of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame government function in a way that can actually achieve something by rein@@ vent@@ ing society .
and there &apos;s one generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up looking at their voice for gran@@ ted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make your mind , on every channel at any time , and you do it .
so if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve government &apos;s work .
and these app@@ s let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be to rele@@ ase a hy@@ dr@@ ant , to we@@ ed un@@ seen , to turn a tr@@ ash can with a mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al rat .
and sur@@ ely , we could have rele@@ ased these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and a lot of people would have done that .
but these app@@ s are like small digital memor@@ ies that we &apos;re not consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not only consum@@ ers of the government who pay ta@@ xes and benefits .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve government until we improve the citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , are we going to be just a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands as well ?
thank you .
usually my role in expla@@ ining to people how wonderful new technologies that have come up will be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s going on , with these incredible jum@@ ps , that we can bar@@ ely tell you .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , bor@@ ing slide .
... you could just show the slide for a moment .
this is a slide i rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ se from my fol@@ der .
i &apos;m not here about the details of the slide , but rather the general shape .
this slide shows us data from an analysis of the performance of ris@@ c process@@ ors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some others , which we often find in our field , is a kind of se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
in other words , every step here is a potential in the performance scale .
and this is a no@@ vel@@ ty that we need to use this guy scale on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could put the lights back on .
a little bit more bright , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now why do we draw gra@@ pher@@ s in technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
and the reason for that is , if i were to draw it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , these are the years , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a way , and this is an arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary degree of technology that i want to represent with a graph , the graph becomes sil@@ ly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say , a transpor@@ tation technology , it would be on the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale very in@@ sensi@@ ble in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the quality of the situation .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology were going to continue as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , we could get in a tax@@ i tomorrow and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
this has never happened before in the history of technology development , this kind of re@@ cur@@ sive growth , where scale incre@@ ases exponenti@@ ally every few years .
now the question i &apos;d like to ask you is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you see they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything will evol@@ ve forever and forever .
there are two possibilities .
it either becomes a classi@@ c cur@@ ve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
well , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
is that true , then that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself is how this new world &apos;s going to be ?
what is this new state that the world is starting to do ?
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle .
when i was another kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people would often talk about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize the future is still at 2000 .
moving beyond that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k about a year since i am in the world .
i think the reason we find that there &apos;s something going on .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s just not going to make sense right now to try and look 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple high-@@ compu@@ tation of what we &apos;re just now making no sense of .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
to do that , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the earth &apos;s scale .
i think the over@@ all picture makes sense if you divi@@ de it into a few billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.@@ 5 billion years , and the earth was a big , steri@@ le stone cl@@ um@@ ps with many flo@@ ating chemicals .
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did that .
i also think there are theor@@ ies that start to understand how things started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story of it , which is that at that time , little oil dro@@ p@@ let was web@@ bing which were different kinds of reci@@ pes for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ let contain@@ ed a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to inte@@ gra@@ te other chemicals from outside and grow .
everybody who was like that started divi@@ ding .
these little oil dro@@ p@@ ts were the most primi@@ tive cell form in the sense .
but these oil dro@@ ps were not alive in the sense of today , because each one of them was just a small , random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the chemicals in it have spread to an un@@ equal amount of stuff .
so each dro@@ p@@ let was slightly different .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ let grew , which had one for growth opti@@ m@@ ally pain@@ ted com@@ position faster than others and more chemicals integr@@ ated from outside and divi@@ ded faster .
so these ten@@ ds to survive longer , and they exp@@ and@@ ed to scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it gets more interesting when these tru@@ cks learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , these tru@@ cks have learned the ability to write information down .
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this in@@ san@@ e evolutionary way that allowed them to write down what they were made of , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of information to store over the course of 2.@@ 5 billion years when it came out rema@@ ined the same .
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
every being uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are so far that we can write only for the purpose of pleasure , even in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white po@@ w@@ der here , which i try to hold in air@@ por@@ ts of security staf@@ f .
it &apos;s in there -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
in fact , if i had been an e@@ go , i would have written it on a virus and rele@@ ased it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the de@@ fe@@ at of dna was an interesting step .
and that made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step happened , where things became completely different , and that was these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities emer@@ ged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the consi@@ sten@@ cy of antibio@@ tics gro@@ ws .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and put this information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now that communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a certain sense the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ tic .
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they went under them , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repe@@ ated more often and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution .
the transi@@ tional site is now where these communities are so close to each other that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the entire community into a chain of draw on the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point we have multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different cell ent@@ yp@@ es , which are func@@ tion@@ ing together as a single organis@@ m .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed community .
we have many cells that are no longer self-@@ assem@@ bled .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the level that evolution took place was no longer the individual cell , but the whole cell community that we call organis@@ m .
the next step happened in these communities .
the cell communities began to abstra@@ ct information again .
and they developed special structures that did nothing but process information within the organis@@ m .
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
so the neurons are the information process@@ ing system that these cell communities have built up .
they started to form speci@@ alists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understand and capture information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning has happened within the period of life of a single organis@@ m , instead of this evolutionary period .
so an organis@@ m could learn to eat a certain fru@@ it , for example , because it ta@@ sted b@@ ad@@ ly and made him sick the last time he ate it .
now this could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas hundreds of thousands of years before that , because this information had to be evolution@@ arily learned by the individuals who died because of this fru@@ it , because these information process@@ ing structures weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process using these special information structures because evolution could now take place inside an individual .
it could take place within a time of learning .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , the most re@@ fin@@ ing version of this communication is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , mess@@ y and conf@@ used idea in my head here .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically ad@@ ding gr@@ u@@ es@@ ome sounds of mine hop@@ ing to create a similar kind of conf@@ using idea in your head that has a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , we conver@@ t it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we create something very complicated about it in others &apos; heads .
so this allows us to work again as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstra@@ ct .
we go through the same st@@ ages that multi@@ -@@ cell organisms have gone through -- process the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds to capture data , present it .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , video shel@@ ters , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we built in our community to hand@@ le this information .
and it conne@@ cts us all together to something much bigger , and also able to evol@@ ve faster than we have been .
so today evolution can happen in the time period of micro@@ seconds .
you also saw t@@ y &apos;s little evolutionary example where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ ution program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the time scale again .
the first steps in history that i told you was going to last a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , la@@ sted a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so forth , were less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be a few decades .
the process fe@@ e@@ ds itself , and so i think car cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- if something incre@@ ases its change speed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ sive cur@@ ve .
we see the process that fe@@ e@@ ds itself .
i live profession@@ ally from building computers , and i know that i can use the mechan@@ ism that i use to build computers without the recent advan@@ ces in computer technology .
my recent work is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design them in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or does in the bon@@ ding machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what designers of thinking machines do is we think at a certain level of abstra@@ ction , we give this machine over , and the machine does something that ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds our ability far better and faster than we could ever do .
and she &apos;s doing it in part with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even understand .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
and we inst@@ all an evolutionary process in the machine that runs off in the micro@@ second area .
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random in@@ struc@@ tions .
we say , &quot; computers , please gener@@ ate a hundred million random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now , please ex@@ ec@@ ute all of these random in@@ struc@@ tions , ex@@ ec@@ ute all the programs , and finally sele@@ ct the ones that my pres@@ entation is the clo@@ s@@ est . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , that would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve used for .
so find programs that can r@@ ank most numbers .
of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen in@@ struc@@ tions is very small that , by accident , you &apos;re not going to sort numbers , so i guess none of the in@@ struc@@ tions are actually going to do this .
but one of them might be lucky to put two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve done the next thing .
put those off , d@@ ele@@ te the rest .
now all of the rest of the re@@ produ@@ cers that have best sor@@ ted the numbers .
it &apos;s a way of re@@ combin@@ ing , analo@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
take two programs , and they make children through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ her@@ it the fe@@ atures of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that have come out of combin@@ ations of programs that have come a little bit closer to what we &apos;ve done than others .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
re@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate it .
lead perhaps some mu@@ tations .
and try it again with another generation .
all of these generations need just a few milli@@ seconds .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can perfectly sort numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they &apos;re ar@@ med and weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you do the job because you come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their life depen@@ ded on whether they got the job right .
i sat in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , reach@@ ing a map and saying , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there it says , &quot; this plane is made up of hundreds of thousands of little pieces that work together to make your flight sa@@ fer . &apos; does that not make you any more visible ? &quot;
we know that development process is not opti@@ mal when it becomes too complicated .
so let &apos;s start to rely on computers for a process that &apos;s very different from classi@@ cal engineering .
it allows us to do things with much higher complexity than the normal metho@@ ds would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of that yet .
so , in a sense , technology over@@ wh@@ el@@ ps us .
we now use these programs to make the computers much faster so that we can do these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ using .
because all these new technologies today feed themselves .
we pick up .
we got to a point where the analo@@ g is at the time , as one cell organisms have evolved into multi@@ -@@ cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the lights , and we can &apos;t quite make up what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
but i really believe that something more comes after us .
i find it very ti@@ ring to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , lunch stands before and i think i &apos;m going to stop here now before i get cho@@ sen .
my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
i was underneath the star sky in the desert with su@@ f@@ i sing@@ ers of mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we talked about nothing changed since the time of the ancient indian e@@ po@@ s &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indi@@ ans back then , we jum@@ ped into a car and s@@ wir@@ l across the sky .
now we do this with air@@ planes .
at that time , when the great indian prin@@ ce of ar@@ jun@@ a had thir@@ st , he took a bow , he took it out into the ground and water .
now we do this with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that magic and magic were re@@ placed by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got some fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ set without camera and without t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
i thought technology should make possible and not kill magic .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver watch .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me .
it became a gol@@ den access to a world of pir@@ ates and mis@@ er@@ able ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was when our fan@@ cy clo@@ cks and camer@@ as were dre@@ aming about it .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing it .
when i was 16 , i started illu@@ str@@ ating books .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device for story@@ telling that re@@ a@@ ders can connect all over the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , anima@@ tion , sounds and touch .
story@@ telling always needed more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
it says , &quot; put your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs ... &quot; i write my name there .
and i become a character in the book .
every once in a while a letter falls down for me -- and the i@@ pad knows where i live -- it &apos;s really add@@ ressed to me .
the child in me is really excited by those possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean not ma@@ gi@@ cian and kit@@ es , but i mean the magic of childhood , the ideas we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass always found me very exciting .
so here you have to ti@@ p out the i@@ pad and let out the fire@@ flies .
and they ill@@ umin@@ ated the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that an entire galaxy can be in a single mur@@ mu@@ r .
and so every book here and every world becomes a little mur@@ mu@@ r that i &apos;m taking here to the magic device in the device .
and this op@@ ens a map .
fan@@ tas@@ y@@ books have always had maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
this map is growing and ligh@@ ting and ser@@ ving for ori@@ entation in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be in other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian but also very ti@@ m@@ ely .
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve all heard of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ s , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as had caught cham@@ bers in in@@ dr@@ as for thousands of years in an old , coura@@ ge@@ ous book .
and we bring them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
a story associated with new issues like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without going out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction in the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , and you have to go out and collect natural objects with the i@@ pa@@ ds &apos; camera .
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of sticks , st@@ ones , pe@@ b@@ bles and cl@@ ams .
somehow , children don &apos;t do it anymore .
this childhood ri@@ tual is brought back . you have to go out and take a picture of a flo@@ wer in a chap@@ ter .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph and tag a piece of construction mr@@ i .
so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fu@@ dge and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fo@@ x today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ key today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you &apos;ve actually taken .
there are a variety of ways that magic to connect the world and technology together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the i@@ pa@@ ds and seeing through aug@@ mented reality an anima@@ tion of el@@ ev@@ ated appe@@ aring on a plant in front of the house .
in one place , the screen fil@@ ls with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , read it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move towards a world where technology &apos;s natural forces can get closer and can approach in magic and technology .
we use the sun &apos;s energy .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , pris@@ ons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with soci@@ ally we@@ ak@@ est in social sett@@ le@@ ments and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
being here at ted , watching and hearing how stimul@@ ating that is , has given me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things here that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when something comes to ted , it gets a sense and force that it wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but that &apos;s the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated teacher are particularly meaning@@ ful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a car@@ efully doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a law@@ yer , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i got big in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ -@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and this matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
she was a tough woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family argument .
she was also the orig@@ in of many differences in our family .
she was a sla@@ ve family &apos;s daughter .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s in virg@@ ini@@ a as sla@@ ves .
she was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped her world very stron@@ g@@ ly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ ving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
she pus@@ hed me so hard to brea@@ the , then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my hu@@ g ? &quot;
and when i said no , she hu@@ g@@ ged me again . when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she left me alone .
she was something that was doing that you always wanted to be close to her .
the only problem with this was she had 10 children .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cou@@ s@@ ins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine that one morning i wo@@ ke up and went to the living room . all my cou@@ s@@ ins walked around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room , star@@ ing at me .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
this went on for 15 or 20 minutes . and then she got up and came over to me . she took me by hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
she took me outside and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promise , om@@ a . &quot;
she said , &quot; hon@@ est@@ y ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i watched you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , om@@ a . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;ll let you love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re going to take care of her all the time . &quot;
i ad@@ or@@ ed my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , i &apos;ll miss myself that you &apos;ll always do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on land in the old , rural south , and i have a brother that &apos;s older a year and a year yo@@ unger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , my brother came home one day and brought this six@@ th pack be@@ er with my sister and me and went to the forest with us .
we were just al@@ ber@@ ing around the way we used to .
then he took a beat of be@@ er and off@@ ered my sister one , and she as@@ sum@@ ed , and then she off@@ ered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . just do you . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . today we do that , you do all else we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go drink a be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother star@@ ed at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now drink something . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to make you crazy about the conversation with om@@ a ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; om@@ a tells all the grand@@ children they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this may be broad@@ c@@ ast publi@@ c@@ ly .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never dr@@ un@@ k a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i say that because identity means identity .
if we can create the right type of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
of course , my grandmother would say all her grand@@ children , they &apos;re special .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol indu@@ ced diseases .
and she believed that these were the issues that we had to care about .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 30@@ 0,000 people were in har@@ b@@ or and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states today has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
seven million people have been dis@@ char@@ ged or dis@@ mis@@ sed with conditions .
in my opini@@ on , mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation has fundament@@ ally changed our world .
in soci@@ ally we@@ ak and black parts of the population , there is des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness due to these changes .
one out of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , dis@@ char@@ ged , or condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , dis@@ char@@ ged or condi@@ tional crimin@@ ation .
but our system is not only sha@@ ped by questions that have to do with ra@@ c@@ ity , it &apos;s also dis@@ posed by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that they treat much better if they &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affe@@ cts the out@@ come .
yet we seem quite pleas@@ ed with this .
a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convin@@ ced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some really interesting develop@@ ments .
my home state of al@@ ab@@ ama contin@@ ually de@@ pri@@ ves them when they &apos;re sent@@ en@@ cing them .
here today in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of male black people have constantly lost their vote right .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of recogni@@ tion of civil liber@@ ation is going to be as high as before the de@@ par@@ ting of the ele@@ ction law .
sil@@ ence is an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zing .
i represent children .
many of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that con@@ vi@@ cts three-@@ ten@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
in this country , we have life pen@@ al@@ ty pun@@ ish@@ ment for children without condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment .
we already have a lot of proce@@ dur@@ es .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in death cells .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty issue is an interesting question .
we think because we &apos;ve been taught that the real question is : has a human being ear@@ ned to die for one of them ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about it depen@@ ding on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did anybody deser@@ ve for a crime , but : did we deser@@ ve to kill it ?
i think this is fascinating .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by error .
there &apos;s one that we ex@@ ecu@@ ted to nine people that we found for inno@@ cent , that was un@@ la@@ id out of death row .
an amazing error rate . one in nine inno@@ cent .
i think this is fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly on an airplane if for nine planes to pick up one off .
but somehow we can get ourselves off this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students afri@@ can@@ -@@ american history . i talk about sla@@ very .
i talk about terror@@ ism , the time at the end of re@@ construction , all the way to the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ american people in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
or bom@@ bs .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped your life .
these older people are now coming to me and saying , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re giving talks . you tell people to stop saying that for the first time in our nation &apos;s history , we have to do with terror@@ ism after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terror@@ ism , of course , the ras@@ se ren@@ der@@ ing and decades of the ra@@ c@@ ist motiv@@ ated sub@@ mission and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d came .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in histor@@ ical context .
we are constantly bu@@ mp@@ ing each other .
we &apos;re always creating new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
it &apos;s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people have understood that the race is not over without the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after r@@ wand@@ a geno@@ cide , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear them speak like this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and of course , in germany , they can &apos;t be there anymore . &quot;
it got very sil@@ ent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever speak back to the syste@@ matic killing of people .
it would be in@@ con@@ science from us to consci@@ ously and tar@@ ge@@ ted people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how would it feel to live in a world where ger@@ man state put people in , especially if there were many je@@ ws under the ra@@ ti@@ o ?
it would be unbe@@ ar@@ able .
it would be in@@ con@@ science .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the ancient south , we put people in -- here &apos;s the risk of being jud@@ ged to death , 11 times higher if the victi@@ m is white , 22 times higher when the dis@@ char@@ ged black and the same victi@@ m is in the same state , white .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental dis@@ connection .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertain@@ ment .
but eventually these reali@@ ties are trans@@ fer@@ red by suffering , ab@@ use , her@@ it@@ age , boun@@ dar@@ y .
it seems important to me to uni@@ te both .
because we ultimately talk about the fact that we need more hope , more enga@@ gement , more commit@@ ment to being able to ins@@ ist in a complex world .
for me , it means time to stop thinking and talk about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged ones that will never be at ted .
but think in a way that &apos;s em@@ bed@@ ded in our own lives .
we all have to eventually believe things we can &apos;t see .
we do . as rational as we are , we estimate intelle@@ ct .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by per@@ su@@ asi@@ on in our he@@ arts .
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection that i believe is driving us to be open to all the bright and exciting things , but also the dark and problem .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch politi@@ cian , once said .
when we f@@ ought in eastern europe against op@@ pression , we wanted to be all sorts of things , but what we most needed was hope , a mental ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and wit@@ ness .
this mental ori@@ entation is the core of what i think the ted communities have to engage in .
there &apos;s no limit@@ ation for technology and design that allows us to be fully human , unless we have eyes and ears for poverty , boun@@ dar@@ y and in@@ justice .
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
as a young law@@ yer , i was privi@@ le@@ ged to meet ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
woman par@@ ks kept coming back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ ery , where she met two of her ol@@ dest friends , these older women , john@@ never car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y bus bo@@ y@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- an incredible afri@@ can@@ -@@ american woman -- and virg@@ ini@@ a , a , who had a cli@@ ff@@ ord , who had a cli@@ ff .
so these women got together and they just talked .
occasi@@ on@@ ally , woman car@@ r called me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , woman par@@ ks comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listen@@ ed .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so flying .
one day i sat there listening to these women , and after a few hours , woman par@@ ks turned to me and said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equ@@ als initiative is right .
what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against in@@ justice .
w@@ r wants to help people who were con@@ vi@@ cted of inno@@ cent .
we want to fight bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system .
we want to de@@ grade life pen@@ al@@ ty without condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment for children .
we want to do something about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
we want to lower the number of in@@ mates .
we want to elimin@@ ate mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and she said , &quot; y@@ um . go@@ sh . mm@@ m . &quot;
she said , &quot; this will make you very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
then woman car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed up to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be ta@@ per .
we need to be able to find these challenges : these problems , these suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
when someone lies , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
when someone takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , it &apos;s not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
even if you kill someone , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing , we &apos;re not measu@@ red at the end of our technology , not the things we &apos;re developing , not on our intelle@@ ct and minds .
finally , a society is not measu@@ red by how they treat their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they deal with the poor , the con@@ vi@@ cted , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
because in this context , we &apos;re just beginning to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
sometimes i lose balance . i end up with a story .
sometimes i push too much .
i get ti@@ red , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas pro@@ mote our thinking in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were con@@ vi@@ cted of very hard sent@@ ences .
i go to the research prison and i go to a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 years old to stand in cour@@ t as an adult .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn a ju@@ dge into something he &apos;s not ?
the ju@@ dge thinks of him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i sta@@ yed up too long , and i thought , oh my god , if a ju@@ dge can turn us into something else , then he has to have magic forces .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has magic forces .
you should want some .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think anymore , i started working on a contra@@ ct .
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boy as a cli@@ ent .
and i started with this contra@@ ct . the head@@ line was , &quot; as@@ sign@@ ment , my arms , 14@@ -year-old black cli@@ ents like a privi@@ le@@ ged white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top mana@@ gers . &quot;
in my contra@@ ct , i expla@@ ined that being a mis@@ condu@@ ct of the pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tion and the police and dri@@ ver@@ -@@ pro@@ of error .
there was a crazy line about the fact that there &apos;s nothing wrong in this country .
the next morning i wo@@ ke up and didn &apos;t know if i had just dre@@ am@@ ed or actually written this crazy as@@ sign@@ ment .
and to my de@@ pu@@ ty , i had not only written him , but sent him to cour@@ t .
a few months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to cour@@ t and do this crazy case .
i got in the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so i went to the cour@@ t .
and i thought it &apos;s getting so hard , so pain@@ ful .
finally , i got out of my car and walked up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the cour@@ t .
when i was up the sta@@ ir@@ case , there was an el@@ der@@ ly black man , the jan@@ it@@ or in the cour@@ t .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
then he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power to me .
it tou@@ ched something deeply within me , identity , the ability to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked into the cour@@ thou@@ se .
once the ju@@ dge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy as@@ sign@@ ment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discus@@ sing .
more and more people came in simply because they were an@@ gry .
i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and pro@@ x@@ y heads of state and office workers .
the cour@@ thou@@ se was full of people who were an@@ gry that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
from my point of view , i saw the jan@@ it@@ or go up and down .
he kept seeing through the window and could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ w@@ abo@@ h@@ u .
he went up and down .
after all , this older black man came in with a very concerned fac@@ ial exc@@ it@@ ement in the cour@@ t , and sat right behind me almost on the defen@@ se bank .
10 minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a pause .
and at the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er came in that trou@@ bled the jan@@ it@@ or was in the cour@@ thou@@ se .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in the cour@@ thou@@ se ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to say to this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up on time . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ dul@@ um of the universe is far wi@@ ping out , but it &apos;s increasing justice .
we &apos;re not completely designed as humans unless we care about human rights and basic values .
that our survival is lin@@ ked to each individual survival .
that we need to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , entertain@@ ment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen an obvious wish in this audience , this community , and you &apos;ve heard to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
when they live in california , there &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ ic decision in this spring that &apos;s actually about trying to do something about the money that otherwise flo@@ ws into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
for example , here in california , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars on death pen@@ al@@ ty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all de@@ ad@@ li@@ an@@ ces don &apos;t end with an ar@@ re@@ ment .
5@@ 6 percent of ra@@ pe cases do not come to cour@@ t .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
this re@@ ference will suggest that invest@@ ing money in more security bu@@ gs and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america has dec@@ lin@@ ed im@@ men@@ se .
this fact is often put into a context with the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
what would you tell someone who belie@@ ves that ?
well , in fact , the number of violent cri@@ mes has not changed very much .
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country was not really in the class of violent crime .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cro@@ ss@@ ro@@ ads against drugs .
so the dra@@ matic high numbers come to prison in@@ mates .
we te@@ am@@ ed ourselves off the r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
now we have &quot; three viol@@ ations &quot; laws that get people behind b@@ ars forever for a bi@@ cycle the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft of low good , instead of for@@ cing them to return the victi@@ ms .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victi@@ ms of a crimin@@ al , not less .
and i don &apos;t think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y can help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
br@@ y@@ an , they really brought a string to the sw@@ ings here .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
bin laden &apos;s death takes an increas@@ ed risk of risk of risk .
speak@@ er 2 : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . speak@@ er 3 : pe@@ pp@@ er spra@@ y of police .
four : mal@@ ig@@ nant car@@ tel@@ s . speak@@ er five : dangerous cro@@ ss@@ ro@@ ads .
six : social waste . speak@@ er 7 : 65 dea@@ ths .
eight : ts@@ un@@ ami . speak@@ er 9 : cyber@@ attac@@ ks
different speak@@ ers : drug war . weapons of mass destru@@ ction . tor@@ na@@ do .
re@@ c@@ ession . gri@@ d@@ lock . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the cli@@ ps i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days . or the last six years .
in fact , the media pre@@ fer to show us negative subje@@ cts because our minds are paying attention to these very issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second , every day , our senses catch much more information than our brains can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first place for all the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our vehicle dete@@ ctor .
it car@@ ries and di@@ ves all the information on the search for any kind of dan@@ ger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative news .
and the old ada@@ ge &quot; when it ble@@ e@@ ds , the demand &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days a week to make all these negative news 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks the world is getting worse and worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe in the last century , the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve acceler@@ ated through a series of forces is so strong that in the next three decades we can create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , species , water and energy problems -- we already have them .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating problems in a very long way , but ultimately over@@ coming them .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy has been dou@@ bling more than dou@@ bling in inf@@ lation has tri@@ pl@@ ed to the average income in the world .
child mortality has dro@@ pped by a tent@@ h of a second .
the point is that the food , electricity , transpor@@ tation and communication costs have de@@ cre@@ ased by a variety of times .
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we are living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history right now .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent over the last 1@@ 30 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we keep increasing our expe@@ c@@ tations .
in fact , we re@@ defined poverty .
remember that a lot of americans living under the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , tv , mobile phones , climate plants and cars .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists in the last century , the im@@ per@@ at@@ ors on earth , could never have dre@@ am@@ ed of such lux@@ ury goods .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and these grow ex@@ poten@@ tially .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed us that every tool that becomes an information technology on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law dou@@ bled the price performance qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ent every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your po@@ cket costs about a million times less , and is a thou@@ sand@@ fold faster than a super@@ computer in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
notice two things on this cur@@ ve .
first , how smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly she lost -- in good times like bad times , war or peace , re@@ c@@ ession , depression and high jun@@ cture .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down for any of our big problems .
and also , despite their log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic course on the left , it &apos;s going up .
so growth itself is acceler@@ ating .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies all available .
clou@@ d-@@ computing , what my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call infin@@ it computing , sen@@ s@@ ors and networks , robots , 3d pr@@ inter@@ s that allow you to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fu@@ els , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the vi@@ ct@@ ory of ib@@ m super@@ wat@@ son at risk ?
that was great .
i went through the new@@ spa@@ pers and looked for the best head@@ lines i could find .
i love this one : &quot; wat@@ son is con@@ stra@@ ining human ene@@ my . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every mobile phone ow@@ ner .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil started , and i started a new university here at ted called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
we teach our students all of these technologies with special focus on how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask the students to create products and services that can con@@ tain the lives of billions of people in a decade .
think about a group of students today being able to influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have sounds ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
today , we can point to do@@ zens of companies who have done this .
when i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life of lux@@ ury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about me creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making ex@@ cess out of sc@@ ar@@ ce goods .
in fact , sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a liber@@ ating force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s soldiers got sil@@ ver bri@@ be , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself got gold bri@@ ck .
but the king of si@@ am got al@@ umin@@ um bri@@ ck .
al@@ umin@@ um , at that time , was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and pla@@ tin .
this is why the dom@@ e of the wash@@ ing@@ ton mon@@ um@@ ent was made for al@@ umin@@ um .
although al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it does not appear to be pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis was developed and made al@@ umin@@ um production so cheap that we use it with our dis@@ pos@@ al ment@@ ality .
then let &apos;s project this analo@@ gy once into the future .
we think of energy shor@@ tage today .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet full of 5@@ ,@@ 000-@@ times more energy than we use every year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy pr@@ as@@ hes every 8@@ 8 minutes to the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not sc@@ ar@@ city ; the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news .
that year , the first time you &apos;ve ever managed to reduce the cost of solar power in india is 50 percent of the same power -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
solar used to drop 50 percent last year .
this has been published last month with a study showing that up to the end of this decade in sun@@ ny areas of solar power per cent k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents on national average .
and if we have an over@@ load of energy , we will also have water over@@ flow .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned back to earth the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger spac@@ e@@ craft in 1990 , when saturn was moving by to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent covered in water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is gone , and we &apos;re fighting about 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nan@@ otechnolo@@ gies along the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
and from a conversation this morning with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of the do it yourself , i want to share with you guys -- he gave me per@@ mission -- his tech@@ no@@ l@@ gy , which is called &quot; sl@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; which many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a cold student .
it can generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drin@@ king water a day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- all of that for less than two cents a li@@ ter .
the head of coca@@ -@@ cola has just agre@@ ed to laun@@ ch a big test project with a hundred un@@ its in the developing world .
and if it all goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , coca@@ -@@ cola will apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is technology suppor@@ ted innovation that we have today .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
oh my goo@@ dness , we &apos;ll soon reach the 70 percent redu@@ ction rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 .
just consider that a mas@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president re@@ ag@@ an 25 years ago .
and if you &apos;re looking for google with your smar@@ t@@ phone , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication ab@@ und@@ ance , as nobody could have predi@@ cted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- g@@ ps , h@@ d video and photograph , libr@@ aries full of books and music , technology to medical diagno@@ se -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in your cell phone .
and the best part is possibly what we expect in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing the qu@@ al@@ o foundation what we call $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
we challenge teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with ai , you can test pu@@ ri@@ sts or your blood values .
and to win , the device has to diagno@@ se a better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly sk@@ ill@@ ed doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the staf@@ f of health care .
if this device sequen@@ ces a reti@@ re@@ ment virus or a dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health agen@@ cy and pre@@ v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic from its out@@ break .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are the population .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand .
and just by the way , the biggest in@@ sur@@ ance against a population explosion is a better education and nutri@@ tion all over the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re moving from two to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard of before will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of economic stand@@ still , i see one of the greatest economic issues in history .
these people represent several trilli@@ on dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to get heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re going to be better trained by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by having the possibility of using 3d prin@@ ter and infin@@ ite computing , and being much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , edu@@ cated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
how about a set of new , never heard people vote before .
how about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed wh@@ er@@ ever you are , a voice to focus on and to create change for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams that are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things that could create big businesses and governments only in the past .
i want to end with a story that really exc@@ ites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with some of you .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ att@@ le .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids to explore how the protein will evol@@ ve .
according to his behavior , we can predict structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far this has been a problem for super@@ computers .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that no@@ wa@@ days human pattern recogni@@ tion better fold the proteins than the best super@@ computer .
and when these people came and looked at who is the best protein fol@@ der in the world , this was not a mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who was a assi@@ stant to the business gui@@ dance in a re@@ hab and the health clin@@ ic at night .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to face the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to exponenti@@ al technology tools .
we have the passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we have the capital of tech phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ es .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to address the new challenges , and to do what it takes .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a changing piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time , as if i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own fal@@ se pre@@ mis@@ e to allow this to happen .
but before i get to the point of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little base@@ ball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the seas@@ onal , and we &apos;re moving to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
we all love base@@ ball , right ?
base@@ ball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball appe@@ ars soon and turns to statistics and to make use of a great base@@ ball team .
i &apos;m going to re@@ fer to a stati@@ stic that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we &apos;re talking about 300 when a bat h@@ its 300 .
what that means is that the player will definitely beat three out of 10 be@@ ats .
that means kno@@ cking the ball into the field , it comes up , it &apos;s not caught , and if you tried to throw the ball at first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time , and the run@@ ner was safe .
three from 10 .
do you know what they call a 3,000 in major lea@@ gue base@@ ball ?
all right , really good , maybe a single star .
do you know what they call a 4@@ 00@@ th ?
this is someone who , by the way , me@@ ets four out of 10 .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- like ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue base@@ ball player who met during a regular seas@@ on over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable after i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a blind dar@@ t , and you will trans@@ fer to an oper@@ ator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blin@@ dness .
it doesn &apos;t work somehow , doesn &apos;t it ?
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a belo@@ ved person with clo@@ g@@ ged heart disease , and your ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian shows this to a car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist whose average performance for vas@@ cular repres@@ entation is 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the ris@@ ing line .
and she &apos;s be@@ ating a 25@@ 7 .
it doesn &apos;t work in some way .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , a birthday wor@@ ker , should be a res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all medicine knows what a good surge@@ on or a doctor or a res@@ cu@@ e .
what we do , however , is that we inclu@@ de each of you , to send me into the world with the cla@@ im of perfect .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s worried about the details of how to do that .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ vely obs@@ essi@@ ve student .
in high school , one of the students once said that brian gold@@ man would learn a ble@@ eding test .
and so was it .
and i learned in my little da@@ ch@@ step at the nur@@ ses res@@ iden@@ ce at the tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here .
i learned everything memor@@ i@@ zed .
in my an@@ atom@@ ic le@@ cture , i learned the orig@@ ins and ex@@ changes of every muscle , every bran@@ ch that takes away from the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ ch@@ re a@@ zi@@ can .
and all the time i colle@@ cted more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i gradu@@ ated from c@@ um lau@@ de .
and i left medical school with the im@@ pression that if i knew everything memor@@ i@@ zed and knew everything , or at least as close as possible , i was able to im@@ mu@@ n against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while until i met woman prin@@ ter .
i resi@@ sted at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman prin@@ ter to me in the emergen@@ cy room .
at that point i was de@@ dic@@ ated to the car@@ di@@ ology layer in the car@@ di@@ ology service .
and it was my mission when the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f was looking for car@@ di@@ ological ad@@ vice to study the emergen@@ cy patient .
giving feedback to my super@@ doctor .
i studied woman dru@@ cker , and she was in res@@ pir@@ atory dist@@ ress .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made coo@@ k@@ ie sounds .
and when i finished her ch@@ est with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a cra@@ cking sound on both sides that told me she suff@@ ered under con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure .
this is a state where the heart fa@@ ils , instead of pump@@ ing all the blood further , a part of the blood is stuck in the lung and fil@@ ling it gradu@@ ally , so the shor@@ th@@ and came .
and that was not hard to diagno@@ se .
i put them on and i went to treatment .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , to@@ bac@@ co water , so they goo@@ d@@ b@@ ye to the flu@@ id .
and over a period of a year and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to my doctor .
i didn &apos;t take up the audience , and i did what i should have , which would have been a call to my su@@ pre@@ me doctor , so he would have an opportunity to take on his own image .
and he knew her , he would have been able to contribu@@ te addi@@ tional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so negoti@@ ated and so i would be able to care for my patients without having to contact them .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent her home , i made a l@@ ous@@ y voice in me trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i was so l@@ ac@@ ked by self-@@ confi@@ dence that i asked the nur@@ se to take care of women , &quot; do you think that &apos;s okay when she comes home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said , in fact , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i sig@@ ned the dis@@ charge pa@@ pers and a hospital and res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant came home and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this na@@ g@@ ging feeling in my sto@@ mach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed my stuff , i left the hospital and went to the par@@ king lot to drive home with the car when i did something i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department .
and there , another nur@@ se said , not the nur@@ se who had seen after woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most emergen@@ cy doctors i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the emergen@@ cy medicine is special because we only see the patients so fle@@ eting .
the three words were : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
the nur@@ se actually asked .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular pit@@ ch .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about an hour after she arrived at home after i sent her home , she collap@@ sed , and the family called 9@@ 11 . res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stan@@ ts took her back to the emergen@@ cy ward with a 5@@ 0-@@ od@@ d blood pressure , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck state .
she har@@ dly brea@@ th@@ ed and ran blue .
the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f did all the str@@ ands .
they gave her blood pressure up .
they ad@@ ded it to the machine .
i was sho@@ cked and tor@@ tured to the inside .
and i lived through that roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster because she came to the inten@@ sive care station after the st@@ ability , and i hop@@ ed that she would reco@@ ver .
and after two , three days , she realized she would never wake up again .
it had suff@@ ered a non-@@ treat@@ able brain damage .
her family gather@@ ed together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they came up with this .
the other day they li@@ sted them -- woman prin@@ ter , woman , mother and grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks , i was making a blu@@ e@@ print , and i learned for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy sh@@ ame you can feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s best friend , even though it gives you the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful and then you get caught and the best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and leads you a terrible discus@@ sion when you end up with the bad con@@ science and you never make such a mistake .
if you do goo@@ d@@ will and never make the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of edu@@ ca@@ tional sh@@ ame .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but that you &apos;re bad at yourself .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my hom@@ ar@@ ch , he was very de@@ ar .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s cle@@ an@@ ing the wo@@ unds and making sure i was not going to be su@@ ed .
but i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly but it figured out .
i started feeling better .
and then on a clou@@ dy day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds , and the sun broke out , and i said maybe i can feel better again .
and i negoti@@ ated with myself that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction and never again commit@@ ted a mistake that the voice could be conf@@ used .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i was in the emergen@@ cy ward in a community hospital north of tor@@ onto , and i was re@@ vie@@ wing a 25 year-old man with a ma@@ ture ra@@ ke .
it was a lot off , and i was in a hur@@ ry .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the cra@@ cks , and it was a little p@@ ink .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him on .
and even when he walked out of the door , he poin@@ ted at his ra@@ ke .
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service , and my edi@@ tor asked me to interview her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember that ?
&quot; do you remember the patients who went to the ra@@ ke ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ cus infe@@ ction .
he had a poten@@ tially dangerous life@@ -@@ dangerous disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of the ra@@ ch@@ ens , but the top res@@ pir@@ atory path@@ ways , and it &apos;s caus@@ ing res@@ pir@@ atory path@@ ways .
and fortunately , he did not die .
he got in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and reco@@ vered a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ ture of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , feeling liber@@ ated , and went to work until it happened again and again and again .
in an emergen@@ cy layer , i &apos;ve over@@ looked a blin@@ d@@ fold twice .
there &apos;s a lot of that already , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital at that time only had 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no man in their treatment .
one of them i thought he had kid@@ ney st@@ ones .
i or@@ dered the kid@@ ney x-@@ ray , and when that was no finding , my collea@@ gue put a har@@ den@@ ing in the lower right sector , and called the oper@@ ator .
the other one had strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i or@@ dered flu@@ i@@ de to re@@ hy@@ der it and asked my colleagues to re@@ view it as well .
and he did , and when he found a har@@ den@@ ing in the lower right sector , he called the oper@@ ators .
they were doing surgery in both cases , and they were fine .
both cases grab@@ bed me , ask me questions .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues cla@@ im , but is total non@@ sense .
some of my l@@ bs have happened over the last five years .
alone , dama@@ ged and dama@@ ged without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t finish up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i voice the quiet that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so they don &apos;t make the same mistakes ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when was the last time you heard about someone who was talking about failure ?
oh yeah , they &apos;re going to a cock@@ tail party , and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if i were to go into a room full of colleagues and ask them their immedi@@ ate support , and find out what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t be very likely to reach the end of the second story before they were really un@@ comfortable , anybody would interven@@ e with a joke , they would change the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital had taken off the wrong leg , believe me i had trouble looking at him .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ ial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones who make mistakes and the ones who don &apos;t make them -- the ones that restri@@ ct the sle@@ eping shor@@ tage and the without restri@@ ction that with bad results and good results .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response like anti@@ bodies attac@@ king a human being .
and there &apos;s an idea that if we associ@@ ate those who make mistakes from medicine , we &apos;re going to stay safe .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medical awar@@ eness and journ@@ alism , i did a personal medical study on medical er@@ r@@ ors and fal@@ se treat@@ ments to learn everything i could for a first article i did for tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black way to learn . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble .
we work in a system where every day we make mistakes , where one in 10 medi@@ cations is either fal@@ se or wrong , where hospital infe@@ ctions always get more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous and de@@ va@@ station or dead .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of a common error .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is 100,000 .
both are strong sub@@ fu@@ tions , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as exactly as we should .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge dou@@ bles every two to three years , we cannot keep up .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect path@@ ology course for a patient with breast pain .
then i take the same patient with breast pain , swi@@ mming it and ir@@ ri@@ tat@@ ing and giving it a slightly al@@ co@@ holi@@ stic breath , and all of a sudden the story is trans@@ mit@@ ted with con@@ temp@@ t .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things the same .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
all of these are ine@@ vi@@ table .
so if you take the system in the way that i was taught and you sor@@ ted out all the ste@@ ad@@ y health profession@@ als , there is no one left at the end .
and do you know the la@@ d@@ ders about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; i have the hab@@ it to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would show to everyone from res@@ cu@@ e to the car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h ?
and then their pu@@ p@@ ils exp@@ and , they &apos;ve pus@@ hed in front of their head , then they look down and they look hard , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
what they need is an environment that makes them capable of doing that .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the re@@ defined doctor is a human , white man , ac@@ cep@@ ted her humanity , is not proud of making mistakes , but sets everything out of them so that it can be passed on .
it divi@@ des its experiences with others .
it suppor@@ ts them when others talk about their mistakes .
and it indi@@ c@@ ates other er@@ r@@ ors , not to m@@ ere , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and when that is , people make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system develop@@ s to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that make it easier to find er@@ r@@ ors that make people ine@@ vi@@ table and make it equ@@ ally en@@ ab@@ ling suppor@@ tive spaces in which anyone watching the health care can actually address things that should be poten@@ tially re@@ war@@ ded and even the reward for me and even the same er@@ r@@ ors .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
i &apos;m the re@@ defined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m un@@ fortun@@ ate , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to pass on to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about changing standards .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories earlier to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
you know he was here in 18@@ 35 .
you might think he ch@@ ased fin@@ s , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually gather@@ ed fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; ordinary . &quot;
it was a grou@@ per .
until the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed in a big way .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we &apos;re still in the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
we still think they &apos;re pri@@ mal .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still describe them as un@@ tou@@ ched .
what happened here ?
the second story is to illu@@ strate another concept that is changing ta@@ ils .
because i experienced it when i studied a la@@ go@@ on in west africa in 197@@ 1 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could inte@@ gra@@ te myself .
and i got a bad sun@@ burn , and i was convin@@ ced that i really did not come from there .
it was my first sun@@ burn .
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ ms was surro@@ unded by a few man@@ gro@@ ves .
there were fe@@ der@@ al bar@@ rel@@ s of about 20 centi@@ meters , black@@ -@@ and-@@ mouth brothers , a fe@@ der@@ al bar@@ rel@@ s .
the fis@@ her@@ ies of these bun@@ t@@ bar@@ rel@@ s were very productive , and the fis@@ her@@ men lived well off and ear@@ ned goods in ghana above average .
when i came back 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half its size .
they grow five centi@@ meters .
they had been gene@@ tically pres@@ sed .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortun@@ ate to be there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is telling me about my participa@@ tion in introdu@@ cing the tra@@ w@@ l fis@@ her@@ y in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- in the early &apos; 6@@ 0s , europe pro@@ mot@@ ed many development projects .
fis@@ her@@ ies that have already caught 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this fairly ug@@ ly ship is called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4@@ 4 .
i went to mit , and we made el@@ ev@@ ations all over the southern south china sea and especially in ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we had no words for what we started there .
now i know it was the cause of the sea .
nin@@ ety percent of our early days were spon@@ ges , other animals associated with the reason .
most of the fish , the little dots there on the ru@@ b@@ ber , the stam@@ p , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
basically , the bottom of the sea came on de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn back .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is going very fast .
within a year , you run an el@@ ev@@ ation and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is going to change . for -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is getting more mat@@ ch@@ y .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they weren &apos;t e@@ aten , they thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
we started a vi@@ vid one .
she wasn &apos;t dr@@ un@@ k yet .
then they wanted to kill her , because you could eat her well .
in fact , this mountain of tru@@ cks are acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated by fis@@ her@@ men every time they drive into areas where they &apos;ve never been fis@@ hed .
it &apos;s not being docum@@ ented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ada@@ pt our standards to the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves what was there .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
on the y-@@ axis there are some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are very natural .
every generation is looking at the images they take at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will de@@ fle@@ ct everything .
the difference then is percei@@ ved as loss .
but they don &apos;t notice the previ@@ ous los@@ ses .
there can be a series of changes .
and in the end , they just want to get the suff@@ i@@ cient rema@@ ins .
that &apos;s exactly our goal right now .
we want to get things that have disappe@@ ared or things that are no longer the way they have been .
now you could think that the problem of people who were certainly living in predat@@ or societies was killing animals and who only realized what they had done after a few generations .
because obviously , an animal that was very common becomes r@@ ar@@ ely before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose often oc@@ curr@@ ing animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a huge loss .
over time , we &apos;re foc@@ using on the large animals and in the ocean , these are the big fish .
they get less rare because we catch them .
there &apos;s little fish left over over time , and we think that &apos;s the standards .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
well , because they don &apos;t know it was even different .
of course , many people , scientists , will tell that it was really different .
they will con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence of how they pre@@ fer in an earlier form is not the way they would like to demon@@ strate the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a cap@@ tain so@@ und@@ so that obser@@ ved big fishing off@@ spring in this area , cannot be used or can &apos;t be used by fis@@ her@@ men normally because they &apos;re not scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in edu@@ cated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous role that a marine reser@@ ve can play .
because through marine reser@@ ves , we &apos;re basically re@@ stor@@ ing the past .
we &apos;re re@@ stor@@ ing the past that people can &apos;t understand because standards have changed and are very low .
so the people who see a marine reser@@ ve can benefit from the in@@ sight that en@@ ables them to res@@ et their standards .
what about the people that are not possible because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west , for example ?
here , i think art and film may fill the gap and simu@@ lations .
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
a long time ago , there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and the at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des may re@@ mind you of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people were so tou@@ ched by this -- except by the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ ey story , why were they so tou@@ ched by the image world ?
because it calls something that has sort of been lost .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is to camer@@ on so that he turns &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in commun@@ ist eastern germany , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it in the government .
they also had to regi@@ ster a she@@ et of un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented text from this ty@@ pe@@ writer .
the reason : the government could track back where a text came from .
they found an article with fal@@ se thought , they could dete@@ ct the cre@@ ator of that thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do this in the west , and how much that would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
in our own countries we would never do that .
but if you buy a new color prin@@ ter today in 20@@ 11 from the leading las@@ er prin@@ ts and print out a page , this side bright yellow blo@@ b on every side in a pattern that clearly leaves the page on you and tra@@ cks your prin@@ ter .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to us today .
and nobody seems to rain up above that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems we have today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks into categ@@ ories .
we have three main groups .
there are online crimin@@ als .
for example , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bow from ja@@ w in u@@ kra@@ ine .
and online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attac@@ ks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online milli@@ on@@ ai@@ des , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ ai@@ des that made their money through attac@@ ks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ me t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin from tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
ste@@ phen wat@@ ts .
b@@ j@@ local s@@ und@@ in .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so forth .
these people have come online too rich , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by appl@@ ying our credit card information to cla@@ im money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , or key@@ log@@ gers that have colle@@ cted our credit card information on the computer while we &apos;ve got the key@@ board .
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy fro@@ r , two months ago , the s@@ wis@@ s account of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and in this con@@ to , was 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on a free foot , the re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory is un@@ known .
and what i &apos;m saying today is that we &apos;re more likely to be victi@@ ms of an online fra@@ gi@@ le than a real world crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only getting worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
the second largest attac@@ ker group we see today is not motiv@@ ated by money .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts , for example , an opini@@ on , or by your audience .
groups like anony@@ mous have gone up over the last 12 months and have become one of the main players in the field of online attac@@ ks .
so these are the three main group of attack : crimin@@ als who do it for money are ha@@ ck@@ li@@ sts like anony@@ mous who are resi@@ stant to it , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attac@@ ks .
we have cases like dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
it &apos;s an example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a complete cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or it was .
last fall , it had to sign up in@@ sol@@ ves because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar was ha@@ cked .
somebody had collap@@ sed and ha@@ cked the system in a th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
and last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government offi@@ ci@@ als , i asked one of the sen@@ ior government offi@@ ci@@ als of this group to see if he was able to hi@@ de that because of the bu@@ ried ha@@ cks , people had died .
and his answer was yes .
now , how do people die in the after@@ math of such a ha@@ ck ?
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication place .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate requires if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with ss@@ l-@@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , for example , g@@ mail .
now we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially distribu@@ ted in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign ven@@ d@@ ors like g@@ mail , because they know that they can &apos;t trust more than local government provi@@ ders and so on their own .
but can you do that if you &apos;re in a foreign space ?
auth@@ ori@@ ties ha@@ ck and fake cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the tra@@ p of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
how about the arab spring and the things that have happened in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
well , in eg@@ y@@ pt pl@@ under@@ s , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in apri@@ l of 20@@ 11 , the head@@ quar@@ ters of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police , and they found a lot of recor@@ ds .
in these recor@@ ds there was a fol@@ der called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
and in this fol@@ der they were notes from a company in germany that the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government had sold a few programs with , in very large fra@@ me@@ work , could capture all the communication of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
corpo@@ rate head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
so western governments provide tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with aid so that they can do it against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , just a few weeks ago in germany , the so@@ -@@ called state stra@@ j@@ ans found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an that was used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to occu@@ p@@ y their own citizens .
if you &apos;re sus@@ pe@@ cted in a crimin@@ al case , your phone will be ta@@ ped with pretty security .
but today we are far beyond that .
they ta@@ p into their internet connection .
they use tools like the state stra@@ j@@ an to inter@@ p@@ ere with a tro@@ j@@ an computer that allows them to monit@@ or their entire communication , listen to their online discus@@ sions , collect their pas@@ s@@ words .
so if we continue to think about these things , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m a good citi@@ zen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
priv@@ acy must be given .
priv@@ acy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between priv@@ acy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while today , in 20@@ 11 , our governments may trust us , every right we &apos;re going to lose forever .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust any future government , a government we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with over the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks .
the first con@@ cre@@ te st@@ ones were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 and developed a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le from c@@ ement with soli@@ d measu@@ re@@ ments that fit together .
con@@ cre@@ te bri@@ cks became very quickly the most used unit of construction in the world .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to build things bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one stone at a time .
essentially the con@@ cre@@ te building block had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out with this .
it was auto@@ matically called the &quot; comp@@ il@@ ing rock . &quot;
and within a few years , le@@ go moved into every hou@@ se@@ hold .
it &apos;s been esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion st@@ ones were produced -- or 75 st@@ ones for every person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
le@@ go made it possible for everyone .
le@@ go essentially took the con@@ cre@@ te building block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
mean@@ while , in the same year at bell lab@@ s , bell lab@@ s was announ@@ ced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic , stac@@ ked building blocks to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows us to build much larger , more complex cy@@ cles , one stone at a time .
but there &apos;s a key difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its .
let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ les that have a specific function .
they &apos;re pre@@ fer@@ red to be light , sound , engine and sen@@ sor .
and the best part is that they connect with magne@@ ts .
they can &apos;t get them wrong .
the st@@ ones are color@@ ed co@@ ded .
green is copy , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is in@@ put and orange is c@@ able .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly larger cir@@ cles .
they put a blue one on a green one , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and you &apos;ve created a little di@@ mmer .
take the switch out to add a pul@@ smo@@ du@@ le that &apos;s here , and they made a little blind .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er to an extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple games , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to program , wired or d@@ ele@@ te , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allows them to program with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so to acceler@@ ate the blind or slow down , just turn on that butt@@ on , and it makes the moment@@ um faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ it is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a com@@ mon@@ -@@ made rock .
lights , notes , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve distribu@@ ted li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to children , and you see playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that you don &apos;t learn in school ?
for example , how a night light works , or why the do@@ ors of the el@@ ev@@ ator re@@ act , or how an i@@ po@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
we also brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience what@@ so@@ ever in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ vi@@ its as a material .
here we see , with film , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ die ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to ris@@ d , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just kar@@ ton and wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a mov@@ able , ti@@ cker can@@ n@@ on .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h hum@@ mer who &apos;s sc@@ ared of dark@@ ness .
for those non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so li@@ tt@@ alive is open source .
you can go to the website , down@@ load all the design facili@@ ties and make them yourself .
we want the world of cre@@ ators , inv@@ ent@@ ors , who are encoura@@ ging contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , bel@@ on@@ gs to us .
so , go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
thank you .
