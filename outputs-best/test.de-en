you know , one of the great sensitivity in traveling , and one of the pleasures for ethnographic research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , who still feel their past in the wind , to touch them on the rain shiny stones , in the plants .
simply knowing that jaguar shamanas are still traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of inuit is still very successful , or that in the himalayas , the buddhists are still tracking the breath of the dharma , which means the most unfolding of the world , is to the most inuit , to the most inuit , to the most unlogic of us , to the most revelocity of us , to the most revelocity , of the most uncidharma , of us , of the most unce of the most untarian , of the most untact of us , of the world , of us , of the most untantaneal life , of us , of being , of us , of being , of being , of the world , is still , of the most unfolding of us , of the most unfolding of us , of us , of us , of us , of us , of the most unfolding of the world , of the most unfolding of the world , of the world , is still , of us , of the world , of us , of us , of us , of the most of being in the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of us , of us , of the
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we go through initiation rituals .
we have to deal with the unstopping separation of death , and therefore it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the penan in the borneo forests , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warriors in the caisut-desert of northern kenya , the curandero in the middle of a carawana desert .
all these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , different ways of orienting on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , when you think about it , can only fulfill you with hope .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a web of spiritual and cultural life that surrounds the earth and is as important to the welfare of the earth as the biological life web you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural lifestyle web as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the total amount of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been defined by human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we can do as an amazing knowledge species .
and just like the biosphere has been highly rejected , it happened at the ethnosphere -- just at a much higher rate .
no biologist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are extinction shortly because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptistic scenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is almost not the same as optimistic diversity in the cultural world .
and the key indicator for that is the extinction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of grammar creatures .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means in which a particular culture can access to the material world &apos;s soul .
every language is like an old-growth forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half of them are no longer whispered into the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer taught to young children . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than being wrapped by silence , one of the last people to speak your language , not to have a way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect hope ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually resist someone anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly man dies and takes the last silver of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . let &apos;s be cantonesian .
let them be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would realize what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today i want to take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey through the ethnosphere , to try to make you understand what has actually been lost .
now there are some of us who sort of forget that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
take , for example , this kid of barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of anakonda believe that they have mythologically come up with the milky flow of the east in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitive between the colors blue and green because the celestial scene is equal to the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language and a hot rule called the linguistic exogamy : you have to marry someone who speaks another language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , and the peculiar of these big houses that are spoken in because of the mischees , six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who learns language .
they just listen and then start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was contacted first in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to connect and made a major mistake .
they threw shiny pictures of themselves from the air , which we would consider as friendly gestures , forgetting that these people from the rainforest in their life had never seen anything two-dimensional .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , found nothing and concluded that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries with the spear .
but the orani didn &apos;t just kill the spear with the outside .
they went through each other .
54 percent of the deaths have happened through drilling .
we tracked geneaology eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about it , they admitted that one of the people had become so old that because of their age , and we killed them with spears .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine which species of animals owned .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really astonishing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and infiltrating the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton coutes and being used to make it safe .
to make sense of that conversation , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in vodoun and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the great world record , what would you say ?
christentum , islam , buddhism , judaism , whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa there was no religious faith , and of course there was one and voodoo is simply the remaining of this very profound religious thought that came over during the tragic diaspora of slavery time .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this vivid relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bears are the spirits .
the ghosts can be charged by under the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to replace the soul of the living preventing so that the acolyth becomes the short moment for the god .
desperate likes to say to the voodooists , &quot; you white goes to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taking on the mind . how can you be harmed ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolyths in a trance-state that contains glowing coal without burn , an amazing illustration of the spirit &apos;s ability to influence the body so that it holds when it &apos;s replaced in an extreme state .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met , the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia was the most extraordinary .
neighbor of the ancient tyrannical civilization , who populated the caribbean coast level of colombia , and in a conquered conquest , this people returned to an isolated volcanic massive , rising up over the caribbean coast level .
in a bloodshed continent , these people were the only people who had never been conquered by the spanians .
to this day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , but the training of priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are now separated from their families at the age of three and four , and in a shaky world of finernis , stone hats at the base of the glacier for 18 years , spend two periods of each nine years shooting them to mimic the pregnancy of their pregnancy .
and throughout that time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society : values that maintain claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out , and for the first time in their life , at age 18 , they see a sunrise . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to see the hands of the beautiful landscape , and in this crystal moment , it &apos;s been abstracted .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers and say we are the younger brothers responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think about the native and landscape , we either words rousseau and old framework of noble wilderness , which in its simplicity is a racial thought , or a thoreau and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , innative is not sentimental , or are you chosen by nostalgia .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for this in the malaria searching swamps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , a mysterious kidney of the earth that is not grounded on the idea of being aware of being too close to human , but also being too far in a subtle idea .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child from the andean who grows up in believing that the mountain is an apu-spirit that will be or determines its destiny will be a whole other person , and will have a different relationship with that resource or this place than a little child from montana who can grow up in the pile .
whether it &apos;s a place of mind or a lot of heritage , it &apos;s irrelevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia and believed that these forests are there to be raped .
this made me another person than my friends , under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are at the northplace of hukuk and the curved higmuel and the kannibali spirits that are at the northerness of the world that they would live in .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca that many of you have heard of , the strongest psychoactive prayer from the repertoire of the shaman .
what ayahuasca does so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparate , but its processing . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , but on one hand , there &apos;s this wooden bike liane that &apos;s a series of colored mosquito be harsh in blue .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are very similar to the serotonin , dimethyltamin 5 and methoxydietydietydietylic tryptamin .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami sniff this stuff , this substance that they make from different species also has methoxydimethylylylacine .
so to sniff this powder is something like being shot out of a gun , saturated by baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not generated a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have , with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who dismissed the psychedelian aprea with the discovery of the magic mushroom in mexico in the 300-year years of talking about it . i &apos;m saying you couldn &apos;t have these tryptamins as hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be taken hymn , because they &apos;re used by a human gut , of course , they &apos;re occurring enzyme called monoxidase , denaturized .
they can only be sampled with some other chemicals , using the mao denatulate .
now the amazing thing is that the betacarbons that have in the liane are mao-inhibitors of exactly the way that you need to power the tryptamins . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of adstrinous plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , when combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version so the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you all recognize at a distance in the forest that appears to our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them how they set up their taxonomy and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;d understand something about plants .
i mean , do you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you take each of the 17 variants on the whole moon and you sing them in a different position .
now this doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting triina .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult situation of the indigenous , think of them as orginian and colorful , but somehow confined them to the past while the real world , meaning our world continues .
so , the fact is that in 300 years , you will remember the 20th century , not for your wars or technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active or passive .
all cultures have always been involved in the dance of new living possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t listen to sioux any less than they were bent and arrow tasks than the americans stopped being a horse and a horse car .
not change and technology threatened the integrity of the ethnosphere . it &apos;s power . ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures are not refused to the debris of the trees , and these are dynamically living peoples , whose existence is displaced by cognitive forces , that go beyond their capacity to adapt .
or when we go to tibet mountains , where i study a lot recently , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is generally convicted , but ethnocid , the destruction of the way people live , is not only convicted , but is celebrated generally , as part of a developing strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibetans if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom .
i went to lhasa with a young colleague 6,000 miles from chengdu in west china across southeast tibet to lhasa , and only when i got to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments that were turned into shoe and awean af of the millions of people during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young man was identified as a follower of the panel lama .
that meant that during the chinese invasion , he was immediately killed .
his uncle flew to the diaspora with her holiness that brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned , as a punishment for -- to be wealthy for crimes .
he was smuggled into jail at the age of two to hide under her rock peaks because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave did was brought into an educational camp .
and one day she came out of miss to a armband of maos and for this meeting , she had to go to a heavy job camp for seven years .
suffering can be unbearable , but the disinherent spirit of people is a little unforgettable .
and at the end of it , we really want to live in a monochromatic world of monotonies , or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that , while we moved towards a thread , shaped , generous worldview , we will not only see the entire range of human imagination decrease in a mindful way that one day we would ever see , but that we would have forgotten from others .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment was signing the cult of seed dna , the poetry of the shaman through the prose of priesthood , and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- was only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we face in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these countless world cultures about the importance of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to rediscover what we are : people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens have to be able to be faced with space , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the baffin islands , walking with inuits to the narwhal jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government has not always gone very well with the inuit , and in the course of the 500s in the establishment of our regime , they &apos;ve been forced to move into settlements .
this old man &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family that was afraid of his life took off all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the slides of their slits were originally made of fish wrapped in caribbean skin .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the arctic night or the hurricane .
he hatched out , dropped his pants down from sea doggy fur and put them in his hand , and when the feces started freezing , he shaped them into the form of a knife .
he sprayed saliva on the side of the fecal measurement and when it was completely frozen , he amazed a dog with it .
he contained the dog and improvised a dish , took the skeleton of dog and improvised a sled , put on another dog and came across the ice cream with the fecal knife at the barrier .
you can &apos;t do something like this .
and this , in many ways , is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the infants in the world .
the canadian government gave back the inuit in april 1999 the full control over an area bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new country called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control minerals .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can seek and reach back with his inhabitants .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these remote goals of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not at all away .
you &apos;re the countries of someone &apos;s home .
they represent part of the human imagination that goes back in recent times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geography of hope .
ultimately , what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we think politicians never do anything .
we believe that polemics -- we believe polemics is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re entering a series of trips to the ethnosphere in which we can take our audience to places like such cultural wonders that they &apos;re being built by the abundant world , and hopefully , one by one , they will assume the central epiphany of anthropology : that it deserves to be a world that we have a lot of the world of the world of life in a different ways that we have .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we &apos;ve given microsoft as part of an exception to just a year ago , which is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which they can either pass or remove with vast amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you can get seamlessly and continue , turn , rearrange in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we see , how big these collections are , or how big the pictures are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the library of congress , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can restrict the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of non-image data .
this is bleak house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of text and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy from the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paperwork of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we &apos;ve also done something in the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content to it .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really reaches up these ideas to map these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean pop-ups and other nonsense anymore -- this shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area as well .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
contested up in nasa &apos;s urgent view .
now let &apos;s get out something else .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth that really connects two different technologies .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is from noah snake &apos;s , a university student in washington , under the counseling of steve silk at uw .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research -- very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that when we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and have this experience of multifold resolution .
but in fact , the spatial order of the images is important here .
the computer vision algorithms have stuck these pictures together so that they can conform the real space where all of these images that have been made near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies . you can see there are elements of stabilized dias or panoramic imaging and all of these relationship .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is photosynth technology , if you don &apos;t necessarily look at the website .
we had to worry about lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedame that occurred only in the computer with images of flickr . just add notre dame in flickr , and they are being found images of men in t-shirts and on the university site and so on when each one of the colored model was found .
so these are all flickr pictures , and they &apos;re all in spatial ways related to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will end up working at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
i guess you can see that these are lots of different kinds of cameras : everything is flipping from the mobile camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them all together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of them are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was recorded properly .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s now collected data from all of them -- from the whole collective memory of what , visually , the earth looks like -- and everything is being interconnected .
all of these photographs are being connected , and something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
think of this as the sequel of stephen lawlers &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and this is something that is growing with the complexity that people use , growing , and its use for the user is getting bigger and bigger with application .
their own photos are accomplished with metadata that another person has entered .
if someone who &apos;s gone out and labeled all this sacred and shared who you are , then my photo of the notre dame cathedral suddenly will be using all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point in order to dive into this other kind of experience , which i can use this kind of metaverse .
and of course , byproduct of all of these are the immense virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that have been preserved not only by overwing or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get it right ? does your software allow someone in the world to be used together at a certain time , in the next few years , all the images that are being used together by somebody in the world ?
yeah . she does nothing but discover .
if you want to make it hyperlinks between the pictures .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
like when you make a web search for pictures where you type sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what picture that is .
but what if the image linked them to all their pictures ?
then the amount of semantic cross-quality is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . cardiac congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that i hope are in harmony with other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections myself if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call the official dogma .
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize the public well-being of our citizens , it &apos;s mostly through maximizing the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is because freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , an essential prediction for human beings .
if people have freedom , then each one of us is about doing the things that maximize our public good and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it wouldn &apos;t come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what enables modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive oils and 12 balsamicoessions you could buy to make a big number of your salad dessings in which unlikely case none of the 175 is right for you .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
and then you go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo plant -- loudspeakers , cd players , a cassette player , radio , amplifier . and there &apos;s so many stereos in this one electronics business .
we can assemble 6.5 million different stereo plants from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that &apos;s a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every phone provider you wanted while it came from ma bell .
they rented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle -- mp3 player- , nasal hairs and crème brée factorcles .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business yet , you can be sure that you &apos;re about to become it .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask that question .
do you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you said , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it patients autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift in the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- who &apos;s probably not white and most likely to be able to make a difference in the best constitution .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why are they advertising around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a matter of choice as to show this slide .
we don &apos;t acquire identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re as often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and they got as fast as they could , and then they got kids as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or should i have a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all inconventional questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether it means doing all the tasks i admit to you and not getting a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl pointed out , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every place on the planet -- all the way to the randolph hotel .
there &apos;s actually a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about that the wirelesslan works on .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that we have this incredible freedom of choice about making decisions about work , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids play football , and we have our cell phones on one hip , and our blackberry on others , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though you &apos;re all turned off , every minute we look at our child mutilating a soccer game , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be very different from your child &apos;s football game .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
i mean , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;ll know what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , paradoxically , is that instead of liberating paralysis .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to even choose .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study of investments in volunteer ages .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records of vanguard , the gigantic fondsociety of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was every 10 investment fund that the employer offered took off by two percent .
they &apos;re offering 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees participate than if they were to offer only five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investments that are choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one should choose to shoot it at tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes tomorrow .
you know , not only does that mean that people have to eat dog food when they go into retirement because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss big investments in their employers .
by not giving up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the employer who would be happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick the false investment fund , or even the wrong salatdressing .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfied with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is done by the great selection of different salatdressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatdressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision better . and what made this alternative , euverically , and what made you .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is not to regret anything that is disappointing to the choices you make .
secondly , what economists call opperity cost .
dan gilbert did a big point this morning by telling how much we &apos;re grading things depends on what we &apos;re comparing .
well , if there are lots of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that they exclude that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s some on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he &apos;s tracked the possibility , day after day , to have a great parking lot .
oppertunity costs down the satisfaction that we get from our choice , even when what we looked for is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to choice , the more attractive properties of this choice are taken into the opera cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a point about living in now and maybe doing things slowly .
but one of the important things he does is , who do you choose to decide not to do other things ?
and these other things may have many attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less attractive .
third , escalation of expectations .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only jeans one way , and they bought them , and they missed badly , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they had long enough to wear them and often wash enough , they started feeling ok .
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old jeans , and i said , &quot; i want a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want snake , easy or long ?
do you want to wash buttons or friction ? stone or acid ?
do you want to protect jeans with holes ?
do you want to cut far cut , keen , blah blah blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on he said .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that used to be the only species . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying all of these damn jeans , and i left the store -- and i say the truth -- with the best passengers of jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what was going on for a good couple of jeans .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have concrete expectations when there was only one way .
when they came to 100 species , damn it , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had gotten to what i expected , and what i had been disappointing compared to what i expected .
adding opportunities to people &apos;s lives inevitably increases people &apos;s expectations about how well these possibilities will be .
and this leads to less satisfaction , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you were to , you wouldn &apos;t know what this is about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything that was worse than anything worse was , it was possible for the people to experience that was a pleasant surprise .
nowadays in the world we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , perfected as an expectation -- the best for which you can ever hope is things as good as you expect them .
they &apos;re never going to be surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all came to -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- which i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
but to defeat is not always such a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad seating jeans if there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if they &apos;re dissatisfied , and you wonder why who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could they have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s disappointing , and they ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it &apos;s so clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the outcomes are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the developed world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and suicide , is that people have learned that disappointing because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it &apos;s their fault .
and so the imaging result is that we are generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s a little bit better than no choice , but there &apos;s no more choice than there is .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve been missing that dot for a long time in which we &apos;ve improved our public good .
now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a key question to think about it . what all this choice enables in the industrialized societies is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard many of them whose problem is not too big .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and so angry : steve levitt told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard to install car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they make it worse for us standing there .
if something of what enables people of our society to make so decisions about the societies in which people have moved too little choice , not only would people &apos;s lives be improved , but would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a pareto improvement application .
income distribution is going to make sure everyone &apos;s better -- not just the poor -- because all this big selection is plaguing us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish glass . &quot;
impoverished imagination , a short-sighted view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you break up the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , you lower happiness .
they increase paralysis , and they lower happiness .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
this is almost limited to complete security -- possibly also for fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden being of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , catastrophe .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and understand that at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to simplify different approaches to the minimal components .
we digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computers .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to dispense to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all these genes that we eliminate one by one , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to one living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward is to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
is it possible for chemistry to make these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inherited chemical material .
our steps in digitizing life were exponential .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly but still increased , and our final point would now be on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out dna synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna long , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes you make .
so we had to develop a new way of putting together these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of informed chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said they were really fooling this model .
they laughed more than they did here .
so we think this is a situation where software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it had over 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cassette tape the size of the virus that we could vary the size of a cassette to understand what the living cell was .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information on the computer , you have to really be wrong with this digital information .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate of a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes in rescue . if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
one part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long and that need to overlap with other 50-letter pieces to build smaller sub-facets so that they fit together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve embedded watermarks .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t.
triplets of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
we signed only at first .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we engineered the pieces so that we could just break them up with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair them and repair them .
and we started creating pieces , starting with pieces that contain five to seventh letters , put them together to make 24,000-letter pieces to put them back together , up to 72,000 .
in each step , we made these pieces over-shot so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so , it looks like a basketball billboard .
when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e.coli . it exceeds all the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologist recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put those pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that survives three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything was reunited again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life can exist in space and move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of this out there .
here &apos;s a dread of the molecule that we made using these processes -- in fact , we just used heck mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , we adjusted them . yeast adds them up automatically .
this is not an electron microscope that &apos;s a regular microscope .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
this is footage over six seconds thumb .
this is the publication we just finished recently .
this is over 580,000 letters of genetic code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a sizes of 10 and no distances , it would be equivalent to 142 pages just to print out this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s as much easier to do in eukaryonts as we are : you just take out the nucleus and put another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
archaebacteria are integrating the chromosome into the cell , but just recently we &apos;ve shown that you can take a whole transplant from one cell to another and activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . in fact , these two are as far apart from each other as humans and mice . and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome . we deployed it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing -- and we put it into a cell -- and we put it in an amazing thing .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here , but we tried to bring the process a little bit further .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of any place to add thousands of characteristics in just one second to one species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to change at some point a lot from biology .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that are actually going to digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we put in .
it was excluded in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , so we just ended up having one cell with a new chromosome .
it painted blue because of the genes that we added .
and after a very short time , there had lost all the characteristics of species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transferred .
it may sound like genomic alchimie , but we can change software dna by changing things quite dramatically .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not genesis -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be creating a new form of cambrian explosion in which there may be massive new artifacts based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;ve grown from six and a half billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today three people on this planet are there for every one that has existed in 1946 ; within 40 years it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re actually hitting the limits of biological reality and this idea .
we have technologies today because of these fast synthesizing methods to do what we call combinatorical genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or optimizing these processes to produce octan , or drugs , new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology with a single team than we &apos;ve been doing over the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only only selection . we can select for life , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a photograph of actual design software that we &apos;re working on , where you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what its genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation fuel .
you saw corn too ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have second and third generation fuel coming out pretty soon that will have much higher sugar levels , like octan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a huge impact without increasing the cost of food or the limitation of its availability is when we see co2 as a source material , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of fuels in the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , in almost cooking water temperatures .
it transforms co2 into methane using hydrogen as an energy source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use stored carbon , which could just be brought to production plans , convert co2 into fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moderate goals like the replacement of the whole petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? become a main source of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on using the same approaches for developing vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always on the back of it , and we have less of a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by making recombined vaccines in advance .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes today , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , archaes , and perhaps eukaryontes .
we are light years away from making people better . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back and tell you how this machine works .
so here it is . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever approached -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe began -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of this mini-big bang in detectors .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction so you can see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine went on for the first time .
and this is an image taken by atlas .
it caused immense jubel in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation particle that took all the way back around the lhc , then collapsed with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles collide on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew the machine worked , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest lever , or this , when someone visited the google side and found the starting page like this .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific achievement .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires conduct 13-thousand ampples when the machine is running at high-performance .
now , the engineers amongst them will look at you and say , &quot; no , you &apos;re not . these are little wires . &quot;
they can afford it because if you cool it down very far , they become so-called superconductors .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the room between the stars , these wires can maintain tension .
in one of the connections , between 90,000 magnets at the lhc , there was a manual turret .
so all of a sudden the wires heat up and 13-thousand ampters encountered electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is even more amazing when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and shifted by about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we redesigned them , we repaired them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will work again .
we &apos;re going to turn on it and expect to be able to collect first data in june or july , and continue to use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in some ways , such accidents again remind the debate to reject the value of science and engineering on those borders . it &apos;s easy to reject that kind of thing .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our boundaries is the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , i think , when he defends the useless experiments of his teaching , his apprentice was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human spirit that it &apos;s not going to take on in science .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect it to ever change .
however , recently something weird happened in my life and my career that made me rethink my relationship to this work completely .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called the bag , pray , love bag -- that , unlike all my previous books went out into the world for some reason and became a big mega-event , international best seller thing .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m being treated as if i were refused to the demise .
seriously -- the process is refusing !
for example , do you care about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear you will never overcome that success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to continue your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ? never again ?
okay , it &apos;s really courageous .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told as a teenager that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of anxiety response .
people said , &quot; well , don &apos;t you be afraid to never succeed ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that the humiliation of a statement kills you ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to follow your life and never come out of it and you &apos;re going to die on a booted dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
like this , you know .
and the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; present . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always did .
and i &apos;m afraid of many more things that no one would ever know .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i wonder , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that somebody should be expected to be afraid of doing the work they &apos;re working on ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprises is that they make us uncertain about the state of mind -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist where he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemical blockade , john -- how do you deal with it ?
it just didn &apos;t occur , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists over the centuries didn &apos;t get the reputation of alcohol depressed people .
we seem to have that kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creative of all the gene , seem to have that reputation , mentally unstable .
all you have to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds alone from the 20th century , young and often died of your own hand .
and even those who are not actually committing suicid seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman mailer said just before he died in his last interview : each of my books killed me a little bit more .
an extraordinary statement they can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even listen to someone like this , because we &apos;ve known these kinds of statements for so long . somehow we &apos;ve accepted the notion so internal and collectively that creativity and suffering somehow belong together and that art -- always leads to seaqual .
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone here today is , is this idea completely fine for you ?
do you feel comfortable with that ? because if you look at just one centimeter apart , i don &apos;t feel comfortable with this notion at all .
i find them disgusting .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them take over to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re living our big creative mess .
and i definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous to begin to sort of swallow this dark path of presumption -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that all i &apos;m being assigned by the world as the work that came after my last book &apos;s success , right ?
i &apos;ll just say it , because we &apos;re all friends here in some way -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that someone can get to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , drink gin . and i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d like to continue doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of reflecting , i seem to have to continue to write , design a kind of protective psychological design .
somehow , from now on , i have to find a way to keep a safe distance between myself and my very natural stir about how the reaction to the writing will be .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models over the past year to do this , i &apos;ve also searched in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sensible ideas about how to deal with creative creativity .
this quest led me to the ancient greece and the old rome .
please follow me because the circle will close again .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine divinity mind that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- for unexplained , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine denenery minds of creativity in denial .
it &apos;s been known by socrates that he believed he had a demonstration that would give him graveways from far away .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of bodily creative mind a little bit of a kind of touch .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this sort of magical divine creature that was believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio -- sort of like dobby , the housework -- the come out and the artist at work would sort of be invisible .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i &apos;m talking about -- the psychological construct that protects you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the age was protected from certain things , like , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t cover everything for you , everybody knew you had this disembodied genius that helped you .
if your work flew -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little laughing .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance came along and changed everything . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures embracing divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to think that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this or this artist a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think allowing a mere person to think that he or she &apos;s like the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , infinite mystery is a little too much responsibility to set up a human citizen .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
it displays and disintegrates whole egos , and it creates all these unreached expectations of success .
i think this success pressure has killed our artists over the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- that &apos;s the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps returning to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t erase the thought good from 500 years of rational humanism just in an 18-minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would report really , truly , truly , scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically , feeds that people follow and apply feebility to their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on that journey .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
why not think that ?
because it makes just as much sense as any other thing i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely insane capability of the creative process .
a process that -- as anyone who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- in other words , everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always pretend sensible .
in fact , sometimes it can feel just paranormal .
i had such an encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet in ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but her whole life was poet , and she told me that when she was growing up in the villative virginia , she could now work on the fields and she could feel like she could .
she said it would be like a thunderous train of air .
it would roll over the country .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew that she could do only one thing in such a moment , and that was -- in her words , like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracked by this poem , and it was only about getting her fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen so she could capture it if she could go through her and grab on the sheet .
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and she rolled the poem through her , and she missed it . she said it was going to continue to move across country and -- like she said , &quot; better for another poet .
and then there were those moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost miss it .
so she runs to the house , and she searches for paper , and the poem goes through her , and she reaches a pen just as it goes through her , and then she said -- it was like reaching with her other hand and getting it packed .
she caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , poem came in freely and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
and when i heard that , i thought that was immense -- that &apos;s exactly the way my creative process happens .
it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a mulberry . to work , i have to stand up and swim every day at the same time , peel through and really awkward .
but i &apos;ve sometimes crammed this thing in my mouths .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came through from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we relate to that without losing our minds , but keeping ourselves on the contrary of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musician tom waits . i got to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the tortured modern artist who was trying to dominate these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived inside him and deal with them .
but then he got older and quieter . he told me that one day he was driving on a rapid street in los angeles , and it all changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly heard a small fragment of a tune that , as it is often inspected , is difficult for him . and he wants them . it &apos;s gorgeous . he &apos;s leaked after that , but he can &apos;t touch them .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a cassette recorder .
so he starts to climb up this old thing , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i &apos;m not able to do it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he finished the whole process of thinking and did something completely new .
he just looked up at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot;
how could i write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment when i can take care of you .
if not , squeeze somebody else today .
go and squawk leonard cohen .
his whole process of labor has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy clump surrounding it was lifted when he took out the genius where he was not making anything more annoying and left him where he came from . he realized it didn &apos;t have to be a tormented , agonizing thing .
there could be a real , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and strangers , outrageous thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also slightly changed the way i worked and it saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of eating , pray , love pools . i fell into one of these ribs that we all fall into when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s written a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just come up with this project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view of the manuscript , and i talked my comment towards a blank corner of space .
i said , &quot; listen , you know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? &quot;
because you see i &apos;m investing in everything i have . i don &apos;t have that anymore .
so if you want to do better , here you have to cross and maintain your share of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m still going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i would like to say to protocol that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it is like follows . centuries ago in the desertiest north africa , people gathered to monthly dances and music that had been held for hours -- until dawn .
they were always great because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but occasionally , something very rare happened , and one of the performers actually became oversecular .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know all of you in your life have seen such a performance .
it was like the time was silent and the dancer walk through a kind of plot . he did nothing but he ever did -- 1,000 nights before . but everything was coming together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared completely human .
it was lit up from the inside and lit up from the bottom , and everything illuminated through a divine fire .
when this happened , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together , and they started singing : pool , allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . poo .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical note : when the mosquitoes conquered south spain , they brought this practice along . the language changed , over the course of centuries of polyallah , allah , silly one-on-one , olé , olé bottleneship and you &apos;re still hearing about how to fight .
if a perturer in spain did something impossible , something magical , which is that it &apos;s used to be shady , olé , allah , great , bravo fellowable , there &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer wake up himself and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer carries a fifth of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees , and maybe he &apos;ll never rise to those heights .
and maybe somebody will never call god &apos;s name again when he turns . but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so embarrassed if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you think you &apos;re just a lightweight -- from an unbelievable source for a readable time of your life passed on to somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think for the last few months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s about to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , well-expected afterwards of my descended successes .
what i have to say to myself all the time is , when i get crazy about it , i &apos;m not afraid .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
just do your job .
be there for your contribution , whatever it wants to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that &apos;s set aside for a moment decides to show a throat of miracles through your efforts , it &apos;s silly !
and if not , still dance .
and felolé ! for you despite all this .
i believe in it and i feel like we should teach it .
felolé ! for you despite all this , just for you to have the naked human love and self-meaning to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps that had shrunk for three million years the size of the lower 48 states has shrunk by 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t really express the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a sense , arctic ice caps are the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and it shrinks in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse picture of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it shrinks in summer .
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood flowing out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will have disappeared from here to here .
this is a problem because warming is looking at the bottom of the arctic ocean where there are large amounts of frozen carbon , which when it &apos;s looked up , it &apos;s transposed from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of climate change materials in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we crossed that critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane itself from water .
professor katey walter at alaska has traveled to another group of labor to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how are we going to get here ?
and one reason is that this enormous heat warmer warms greenland from the north .
this is an annual swap of water .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level is flowing through land ice sheets here , it flows into the sea .
these rivers are taking rapid rivers .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
researchers signed up last month that the entire continent now has a negative ice footprint .
and the west antarctica , which has emerged over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
this is like 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up there that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting water .
in the andean , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the water levels have expanded .
but when you seal , most of the drinking water will fall away .
there was a 40 percent reduction in snow in california in sierra .
this is the sink .
and the predictions you &apos;ve read are serious .
this austrockage throughout the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have been in a really extraordinary and previously unprecedented extent .
four times as many over the last 30 years as in the previous 750s .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day into the oceans .
look closely at the realm of eastern pacific , from the american continent western and beyond the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a drastic decline in oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most comfortable problem .
the united states is one of the two largest pollutants together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coal factories .
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
here are the ones that have been striped over the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
meanwhile , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the coal industry and oil industry spent a quarter billion dollars last year promoting clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
christmas was walking around at home in tennessee , one billion tons of coal lamb .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news apparently .
this is all over our country of the second largest waste in america .
this happened around christmas .
one of the commercials of the coal industry for christmas was this .
frosty the carbon man is a delight , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy grow .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and worth loving , and workers remain in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
let me say one very clear thing . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry riding , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has started two campaigns .
this is one , part of it .
in coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
so we set it down to the top line to spend a substantial amount of money on trying to get an advertising on the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s quiet that .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , changing the remarkable coal technology that you see here .
look carefully , this is today &apos;s clean , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative is mixing with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects them all together is our dependence on carbon based fuels such as dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold new solution to free ourselves from that misery .
if america is 100 percent cleaner electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
utility america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a relief from america .
one of the fastest ways of reducing our dependence on old , dirty fuels that make our world work .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
utility america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start asking you to think back to the time you were childhood when you were playing with building blocks .
while they realized how to reach out and grab your hands , pick up the jokes and move them , they actually learned to think and solve problems through understanding and change spatial connections .
spatial thinking is deeply tied to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction we did with real objects -- along with my expertise patti and my colleague , jeevan kalanithi , i started wondering : what if we wanted to use computers , instead of a curriculum curriculum , which would be like a digital fingertip ?
this question was so profound that we decided to explore the answer and siftable .
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
you can be moved by your hand , you can perceive each other , you can pick up your movements , and you have a screen and a feature .
more importantly , it &apos;s physical , which is why you can only move it out of your hands and your access .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data .
and if these tools become more physical and an awareness of their movements , recognize each other and perceive the subtleties of our surroundings with them , then we can start to explore new and entertainment types .
i &apos;ll start with a couple of simple examples .
this sickable is designed for video reconfigurable , and if i pebble it in one direction , the video will be played forward , if i pebble it the other way , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits come true to each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , that gets their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by one , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
and an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like protecting colors the way you do it with fluids .
in this case , we &apos;ve created three sidelables as a color pot , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re then mixed .
if we overdo it , we can shake back a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and we want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i do with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round on every sighted letter at random , and as you try to form words , they &apos;re checked over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , you get remixed and you have a new book combination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came out to the media lab on a trip , and i could get them to try it out and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; educate words &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people testing it .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there on the lower right .
it turns out he was just going to stack the siftable .
so for him they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive trickfilming twist .
we wanted to develop a language learner learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by lifting up the siftable from the table showing this character .
here he is leaving the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he &apos;s taking a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other , he can let the characters interact ...
... invent his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evolves .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve got time to show you today is a musical sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in siftables as sound , like leadership , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which one you want to use .
and you can put these sounds in the sequence that you can then put in any kind of pattern .
and you eat them by simply holding a tone-sighted ability to a sequencing key .
there are effects there that you can change live , like reverberation and filters .
you connect it to a particular note , and then you tend to hire it .
and then rearranged effects like tempo and volume that you &apos;re using on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to put the leadership voice in two sequencing siftable , and put it in a row , expand it , and add a little more voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some more drums about this .
and now i connect the filters to the drums so i can navigate the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by throwing the pace in one way or the other .
and i &apos;ll just wrap the filter up with the barrel , a little bit more expression .
i can reframe the sequence as it runs off .
and in doing so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , i can improvise them , they expand or shrink them during the course of that .
and finally , i can just blend the whole sequence by pinching the loudstarch sickable to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human interface that fit better to how our brains and bodies work better .
and today i had time to show you some of this new design world and some of the ways we work on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of ads to interaction with digital media that bring information to our world that corresponds to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
i have to pick it up a little bit , and that &apos;s biohacking is just about modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve just been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years now with biohacking , and i &apos;ve started this because i just wanted to know more deeply and do it yourself , which i &apos;ve learned in college .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology in general now , generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count to synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , already is extremely important , and much , much more important is going to be in the future .
there are things as controversial as all of these genetic modifications on the corners .
there &apos;s craig venter now in the u.s. trying to make biofuel , which is gasoline from algae .
under then there are things that have come completely everyday , which is not aware of , for example , wash enzymes that allow us to wash at 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
and so from an interest in this technology , i went on .
that &apos;s why hacking now ?
most people know this from the software range .
computers hack , and then it always gets like this in the media , yeah , the hackers break in somewhere and claws data and so on .
because that &apos;s kind of sad for the hackerscene , because that &apos;s not really what it actually started like , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the software hacker , in the &apos; 70s , started computer tiles &apos; 70s , and that &apos;s what the internet came out of .
and it &apos;s about solving a problem in a playful , creative , original way .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be just a problem of how things simplify , so any problem to ask , and how can you do that or how to do better ?
and it &apos;s just been generated with software , but there &apos;s also an electronics domain , there &apos;s also a whole bastler scene that does all kinds of stuff with electronics circuits .
and now i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , which is actually a science of information , because , in fact , the d.n.a code is an abstract code that &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s real matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can hack it like that , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
it actually only took two thousand eight really shape , these networks .
there &apos;s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation based in india , but has members or active people all over the world now .
these are a more artistic orientation , so there are a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists to just sit down and ask questions and work creatively , there are museum exhibitions and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really all about trying to find such a smaller access , such a playful shift .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself bio dot org , d.i.y.bio .
this is from the u.s. a network , which is actually more of a kind of forum where you stop and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and they &apos;re also a little bit more business along the way , and then they &apos;re asked , yes , questions applied .
and from these networks that have made the whole popular , stop has this kind of scene that i want to portray briefly .
you see here in the upper left there biodiversity , which is a hackerspace , which is basically a kind of school , such a private school , non-profit contract , where everybody can get there .
children , old , all kinds of people go there to just sit down with it , and they set up a lab and look at what can you do if these lab protocols can .
down here on the lower left is a group in indonesia called house-of-natural fever , but they &apos;ve been around for quite a long time .
for a long time than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics bastards too , and combine that in a fairly abidant way .
a group of ankara that i met a while ago , who was a student group that wanted to convey more what she was learning in college , and they were doing so on street little actions and trying to explain to people what that is .
and i have a lecture on the top of the other picture in copenhagen at the medical museum in combination with an exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s usually quite young people , but the only thing that really united you is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and you &apos;ve got to go to society and ask , you know , what do you want to do with it , are you interested in bringing you this way ?
so , o.k , to hack biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and then that &apos;s a lab .
or what you usually understand under a lab , these are sort of senior machines , extremely expensive , highly distance , only for professionals , trained academics with ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , o.k , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every coffee machine has actually higher technology than most labs , which is really the way it is .
and then , with this premise , with this premise , brian degger in england tried to assemble a minimum abor , he then took a steam printing costume and a hot plate and , yes , soup breasts , and then he grew bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s been gaming a soup that he &apos;s been up too long has been doing .
i then tried to expand this in my lab at home a little bit , and then i stopped buying second-hand equipment on ebay and doing a little bit of d.n.a analysis , trying to do a father &apos;s test , like this , / d.n.a fingerprinting , again .
now that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , actually , but .
down here in this picture , you can see the lab , in terms of leadership , so there &apos;s a coated garage with all sorts of lab scaffolding that the university has rented , a group in paris that has set up something , and quite successfully , and i want to do some interesting stuff .
and this is biodiversity that just mentioned hackerspace , this one , sort of folk school , basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively straight , so that &apos;s what people do at home alone , all the way to large , big , larger organizations that are already doing this in institutionalized form .
but always the approach that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we were sort of aware of our self , o.k , there are now us as real scene , and we are online , and we know the people who are always chatting and stuff .
and then came from the do-it-yourself bio org website of the founder , and said o.k , we need to really make ourselves real , also make real meetings , and then organized two events in london , two thousand , 10 , and soon in the u.s. , san francisco .
and then , it was about , yes , o.k , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what is our purpose , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve worked out a code-of-conduct like this .
it was quite intuitive , so everybody just expressed their wishes , his and what makes him stop , then .
there , i think , was a pretty good code .
and we then have that one , not committed , but that &apos;s , i think , pretty well done , people are pretty convinced about that .
and we &apos;ve even tried to bring that back into the academic world , but that &apos;s not where it somehow arrived .
so i think we &apos;re from the biohacker scene , in fact , a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hackteria network in switzerland itself was we wanted to make something called an optical trap or an optical brush .
this is , if you focus a laser beam on you in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and move in that focus , so it &apos;s captured like a tractor beam basically .
this really works , this is done in academic record , and we then thought , o.k , we might get there , then we picked up a webcam that &apos;s screwed up lens , flipped around a microscope about four times .
you see that down there .
and then we pulled out a d.v.d burn and pulled out the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot yet .
this is another project that &apos;s done from the french group in paris , which is pretty cool .
and he &apos;s got such a , you know , such a brain wave measurement device , e.e.g or something like that , so he &apos;s been dealing with neurobiology , his nickname is sam neurohack .
he then set up this helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum , that &apos;s what went on .
and then the visitors could go in , sit down on this chair , sit down this helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or as they thought , their brain waves have gone on different lights in the room .
it was a pretty big project .
another thing from the united states , which has to do with this father &apos;s history , is the p.c.r , which is polymerase-chain reaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes that you just want to replicate , d.n.a , reproduce fragments so you can make them visible .
so if i do this now , the profilers go to the scene , go and collect any hairspecimens , and then they do this method , and then they can say , o.k , this hair belongs to this person , like this .
and the machines that do this kind of thing are pretty expensive to buy commercial , the cheapest things are going on at four thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in hobbyspace , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can do a lot of things .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been putting two hobbyists together and said , o.k , we &apos;re doing this simple and cheaper , and then we have just open source , which is freely available hardware , electronics , assembled this device , and they &apos;re actually now the world &apos;s beasts of these things .
i think that sort of six-hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a framework where it &apos;s getting more available .
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
a project i started recently was building a gene-gun .
gene-gun is , yes , sort of like a air pressure gun that shoots about that far , two centimeters or something .
you put the d.n.a on gold particles and then the gold particles into this air pressure pile , and then i shot them on onions and then light them up like this .
so the device that you see here has not worked .
but this is my prototype like this , but it &apos;s pretty much gone , on this branch , plugged it on electronics and pressure , and that was pressure , but it was too high , the thing has broken .
and then i took a chicken pender and i put that on it .
a saint pender , if you make it full of water , has enough pressure , so i think 40 to six , i think it &apos;s about it .
and then you can accelerate the particles very well enough , and then they go into the onion as well .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros up or something like that , sacrel pender about 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially doable .
so , that &apos;s also the core issue right now of the scene to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the intelligibility that more people can engage .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite little idea of it , and also no chance of really forming it .
because if you just read about it , from secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or saw it yourself .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be an informed citizen to be able to make meaningful decisions in society and talk to you , you need to access knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it in order to do it and understand it .
and that then company in the headwords of open shade and citizen science .
so , as a citizen , you &apos;re being able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core issue of the biohackers .
these are the people who have at least officially contributed on the website , d.i.y.bio-dotorg website .
it &apos;s a pretty remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;ve also entered southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people in there than there actually exist .
so i know some that haven &apos;t contributed .
and these are just the biohackers now , the individual people .
in part , also with these hackerspaces , so these places are put together there .
and that &apos;s at the very beginning .
as i said , two-thousandth of it started .
and hacker spaces , so the computer hacking spaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , ninth hundred t15 .
and this has now become a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that have occurred all over the world .
and we &apos;re hoping , of course , that we &apos;re going to be equally expanding , and then also quite well connected so that stop getting people involved .
and i would invite every time to deal with it and try something out of it .
now it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and put enough energy in there , you get a long way .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi there .
how do we actually work with people ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but also in the research section of usability and in front of all things in the user experience .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media so they create a possible experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us are addressing archaic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological minds very , very long time ago , and that we can recreate them through interactive media .
and it &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that this high technology that you &apos;re encountering is actually going to bring you into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us at our archaic roots .
what are archaic models now ?
i wrote up four words once , and i want to explain them briefly .
in archaic cognitive models , these are the models that we have adapted in pre-industrial times .
to these archaic models , we have basically a natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds , in principle , unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that in a second and try to prove to you that they also have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that since this archaic model , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very educational , even though today we &apos;re using a codified language .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
we all know that interactive media by definition nonlinear , which involves linearity &apos;s sense , and what we &apos;re saying , of course , is that we feel linearity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us to transmit information .
so what about virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
how many doors does the house you live in ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that immediately , but this is going to happen , and this is happening right now .
they go through this house in mind , so they live in this house , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they virtual reality without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re getting tired of the media campus , for example , representing virtual reality in our v.r.r. lab , where we can actually do it all the time .
and that capacity to virtual reality , that people in the pre-industrial times also needed bitter , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have photolitography .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that mind , memory was happening .
in that mind , knowledge was called down , and using these virtual images , imagination was also passed on .
and so it &apos;s rooted so much that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
yes , it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time human beings were also media producers and media themselves .
now if you think a little further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk about that in a minute .
fundamental tool of information processing has been stories ever since .
amanas , priest , so-called knowledge guards , were extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong about stories .
the author of the book is the story story animal , jonathan gotchall , and we &apos;re still interfering with thousands of hours a year with the recipe of stories .
that means for a child who has spent most of his life on the prescription of stories until reaching the great year .
now we think our love of stories depends on we &apos;ve been serving as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , far missing .
that goes much further back into pre-industrial cultures .
but to me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive thing is that , by our biological memory , we have announced the ability to think nonlinear .
i brought an example from the north american tribe of nootka indians .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to kind of navigate there from island to island to get food .
and they did it with what &apos;s called lead maps .
you may know that , even if you &apos;re a little bit interested in that , of the australian people .
they have similar principles .
they have no lead maps , they &apos;ve used these nanted songlines or even dream lines .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be educated by songs .
which was the language subordinated by the subordinated rang .
that means you navigate over sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm have been the geology that shows topography of a region , and it also allowed , of course , to defragment these songs and put them together differently and move so to the left and back to the right and back to where it was going .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from above to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what happened there ?
what happens is that this is what &apos;s called the machine age .
we moved in what &apos;s called the vogt age before .
what happened is the machine age , and what happened is the book , and it &apos;s the photolitography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened is that we &apos;ve shifted the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories in external media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have god &apos;s a long formula to virtual .
virtuality suddenly has become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known designer at brighton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet and so on , what we call mass media today , these mass media , have been calling the memories of our ability and virtualizations .
let &apos;s make a little intermediate thing .
from the vogt age to the machine age .
what has influences on our thinking and our memory ?
then the interconnected influences of pre-industrial cultures .
and they have been overwrote over the course of centuries by the influences of the machine age .
so instead of remind us individually , we have standard , widespread , widespread patterns of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
we no longer produce ourselves .
we have an abstract language abstract .
we &apos;re not imagining things in pictures anymore , but we &apos;re coding you our language .
we were used to things linear .
and we accepted linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like non-linearity .
what we &apos;ve stayed in is the story story story .
we &apos;re still very , very arrested to storytelling as an information processing .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had this avian age , we had the machine age , and we now described this so-called cyber-age .
it sounds very spacey , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber-age that bring us that opportunity to rediscover our capabilities .
it &apos;s about virtuality ; it &apos;s non-linearity ; it &apos;s about storytelling .
i want to explain that a little bit .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which means augmented reality .
so if you look at google glass , for example , it &apos;s such a concept that makes us recombine the virtual world with the real world , which means our moninity to virtualize the virtual world as something that &apos;s normal , natural .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , that may sound in the context of my talk , as we move physically into non-existence , virtual worlds , according to the holodeck model .
and other examples are the ambient , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond intelligent to a human being .
all of this takes the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated , and i hope the video works , brought along a very , very nice project , which is the bacheloric work of michael burk , annkathrin krence , joris klause and jan-moritz waste .
and the two last ones are here as well .
maybe you can just stand up for a moment so they can pause with the two of them over the project .
and i brought this project back as an example of how to address this archaic , cognitive model .
all of this is a game , i have to say to you .
of course , story is extremely opposite , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer game , you &apos;re very likely to have some people sitting in front of any console , or playing with some console in your hand .
anyway , they do it in there .
this is a game outside .
and this is what i think i discover the outside world , so that i rediscover the real world .
and this is a game that connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
you can then explain that in a moment much better , there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
and it &apos;s about exploring a city by looking at which places were positively tweeted or negatively twittered .
and so i get a very different view from the city , a very different sense , which is that i see negative and positive zones in a city , and i get a very different virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk once , in the sense that the properties and skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the avian age , and that have gone away a little bit in the machine age , that we can actually get back to the end of the future called cyber age and become more complex .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this sack is a speaker bag , and i &apos;m going to talk instead .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to dissolve what &apos;s in there in a second .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit curious .
yes , children are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers as well .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so of course i &apos;m also involved in the theme of curiosity , and how curiosity also changes our thinking , and why do we maybe lose curiosity and need to rebump and so on .
that &apos;s a whole range of things you do besides actual existence as a creator .
when professors get curious , they &apos;re often put into such research semesters .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a research mester on natural interface design .
now you &apos;re going to be wondering why all the designers begin to engage with such natural archaic forms of communication , interaction usw and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up because things should become more intuitive , more natural , user-friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us humans , what &apos;s user-friendly or intuitive .
and before the background , i was design in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation of human computers in the relationship of the human computer is dealing with how our tools or how the computer is changing from the computer of sukzessive to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing this , when is it natural or intuitive ?
maybe another look behind it .
why is this happening at all ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , briefly represented here , now we move from the third to the fourth generation of life or society .
so from modern to computer society .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
initially , tribal society is language .
that means that you &apos;ve found yourself talking a common language , you &apos;ve been able to communicate with each other , moved to the same cave or other areas , educated cities or villages and created , in a sense , tribal society .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you also had to learn , so no small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning , of course , sukzessive and ratio .
that was then dissolved by ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge outcry at the time , because , of course , you started manifest the living language in the form of writing , which means what &apos;s fluid and alive is i start and i set it in stone , and i manipulate it as well .
so depending on how i master and when i master , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a living sort of thing .
but sukzessive then moved this script as a primary medium to acquire .
then the next generation that we &apos;re actually living in today is primarily .
that &apos;s the pressure and print writing with gutenberg and others .
at the time , it was just a monkey , where adel , clentus and others have said , are you insane when the people start reading , then the afterwards want to talk , and that &apos;s of course totally fatal .
and now we get to the next generation , and the exciting thing is that we &apos;re just a generative shift every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal phase right now .
that completely confuses us , of course , because we see on one hand the new media , social media , facebook and so on .
so with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what bangeds on the old thinking , don &apos;t say , in the lasagne horse meat and no more beef or other phenomena , which is i want to merge this and do this at all .
and these two worlds are just crawling together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , rejects very many mechanisms , principles and archaic thinking patterns from tribal society .
but now not at the local level , but at a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is a global issue .
not when i think local ecological here , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , it won &apos;t work anymore .
so , from the local village , a global village has actually become a global village with the same principles , possible , intuitively , but also complete transparency .
as you knew back in the village , who has what happens to whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this expansion of ourselves through these mobile finite devices at a global level .
it &apos;s that we know globally accumulating and faster and better and better .
just like it happened in the village earlier .
before the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at this , what does it mean for us , what &apos;s still natural for us , what is it that we might have lost , but instinctively , what makes the difference ?
because people often come , you can &apos;t make it user-friendly so that anybody can handle it .
so you have to deal with this , which means , and not just change it , but it &apos;s better to do better .
and when , of course , is a little bit intuitive , and how do i work as a creator and design things so that they &apos;re a user-friendly , so they &apos;re potentially intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
you &apos;re looking at it , even during studying , with the subject of perception and perceptual psychology .
and that , of course , is what you start looking at and say , okay , now i &apos;m just looking inside the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like in there ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitive and how does our channels work in perception and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs once said you need to be smart , metaphorically accurate .
so you really have to look in detail if i want to make something user-friendly or intuitive palpable , which means at the core .
and there you already see that you have a our seven senses , most people think we have only five , and now it &apos;s even seven of us already , and certainly in the near future , the next awe-meaning , and also extension of ourselves .
and to see how do we process information , how do we take information ?
just to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is any difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but don &apos;t know what it means then in detail .
but i have to understand , in essence , when is information going to become information , when will information , and from information , again , so i know how to make things intuitive or of course palpable ?
and of course , how design affects perception .
we see this when i design things , i can make them confusing like on the right where i don &apos;t know what salt and pepper is , or i can sort of intuitively design them by showing things .
so much more natural , in a pool , but i see , in a sense , where salt and pepper is .
and when i tell someone , they give me salt or pepper , they &apos;re going to first think about where &apos;s inside .
and on the left , just intuitively access to me , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , just give me salt .
but also our perceptions themselves , how they deceive us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and yet our perception changes depending on what context we put things in .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
it should still work .
it &apos;s going to be a little bit more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle begins to correlate or associate certain similarity .
and when i put another halboval in there , suddenly we don &apos;t see one more unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , another circle .
this is what &apos;s called shape law , or gestalt psychology , which also affects us in perception .
important for the designers , they usually have this in the first semester , the great framework laws .
shaped law near the continuity and so forth .
often in the third one , forget about it .
but this is a crucially important ingredient when you want to make things intuitively intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is that of vision .
sounds really banal for the first time , but it &apos;s exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking from the front to the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see the first time from the back to the front .
and that is , they &apos;re projecting a proposition forward that they see something they recognize , quite an example of circle .
that means we &apos;re only going to get our vision before we see it coming back into our seaweed machine to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got such cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve tried something that you want to see .
so that &apos;s there , that &apos;s coming back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t look at the front and say , well , look really again and see if what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually only seen .
so a very , very exciting process of how certain things go off and what happens for millisecond areas .
i don &apos;t know who this picture is .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
now , everybody from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes this .
does anybody see something particular ?
a dalmatiner , exactly .
once i saw that , that &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and on , now you see him .
that means i &apos;ve actually spoiled them right now that they no longer recognize patterns in them , but i &apos;ve conditioned them within a very short period of time to see this dog in this blurred picture .
and this is this projection of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to projief forward that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very , very exciting processes , which then happens in this , yes , gray is not actually , but it &apos;s actually not in this rosane mass right here .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know it takes three seconds to sort of take me out of the present loop into the past loop , i can bridge very well wait times when i &apos;m dealing with someone at three seconds .
he has to process that first as the present .
then it goes into the past , so i can bridge very elegant waiting times , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes fifty milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love with .
that means mindset , if you know that now , notice who you &apos;re looking at for a long time , because i don &apos;t take any gun for what &apos;s going to happen .
and six milliseconds , even an exciting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptual perceptions that we have .
that is , this first impression happens at a rapid speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things that we &apos;re looking at , and how we kind of secure against our environment so that we can think about them accordingly .
of course , the designers are not just concerned with perceptions and neural processors or cognitive zones , but primarily the subject of human object .
so how is a human being about certain things ?
there are times more productive functions , so formal aspects or formalathetic issues .
there &apos;s phone functions , where i know exactly where to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why does anyone spend such a little bit of work , where hardly anything fits in anyway , such horror sums of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more at the symbolic level , at the meaningful level , which we , of course , consider ourselves the creator .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the subject , of course , is usability .
usability always means how can i possibly reach a certain goal , or how can a user achieve a goal in a certain way that is effective , efficient and satisfactory ?
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something possible to use friendly ?
can i use that directly or need the n manual , or i need to have a consequential training for it .
and it &apos;s less usable or usable .
that i &apos;m making this different and beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better palpable .
you also have to understand that .
and if you look at some of the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is not intuitive or not usable to call , the i-pad in many areas or i-phones , though it &apos;s more intuitive than software is .
it &apos;s intuitive usability not only since apple is a fundamental economic factor , it &apos;s fundamental success factor , if i want to use technological devices to people .
why ?
because in general , through this new kind of usability , the natural user equity , we &apos;re five times faster on average on our goal .
and you have to imagine that if you make something of the classic coup , you need five hours and you need this new kind of natural software for just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re likely to go home for probably four hours , but your employer or someone can come up with them on the order of four hours .
but i want to say that for us , of course , it &apos;s a consequential increase in achieving certain things .
when we go back to software , here &apos;s the first command line interfaces that were very abstract , where it took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next one that &apos;s already been working with &quot; nice neural model , &quot; or mental model , like the software eergonomists , &quot; which is that you have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to use the computer .
so no longer zeros and ones or cryptic codes , but a metaphor .
that made it much more user-friendly , but , of course , it &apos;s much better .
the next generation of graphic user interface is working a lot more with behavior .
so , as a creator , i make a lot more behavior than that .
it &apos;s also such a paradigm shift .
that all of a sudden i look increasingly unimportant to success , just the usability becomes an app .
and then , if i go one step further into this natural user interfaces , where i voice , language , by touch , by touch , by not mouse and cursor , i &apos;m even faster and even more immediate .
but that brings me back to the point , again , when are things getting more intuitive ?
when you get more intuitive , and then again , i have to punish and watch my little friend here , what does that mean from the point of view of cognitive sergonomy , when is it really something intuitive ?
and this is always a little bit intuitive to us when i have to think about it as little as possible .
so , apparently , he doesn &apos;t want to think like it , but he just make it relational .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for designers ?
that means , if we look at existing trading models of one to another , for example , the metaphor , i can make the growth as a creator .
that means i can transfer an intuitive , human action model to software and make the software much more user-friendly .
so , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive hand scheme of us humans , and now i &apos;ve already revealed it ?
this is called the osit-model .
that uses each of us and oftentimes is an acronym and stands for orientation , selective , informed , transaction .
that &apos;s what each of you does all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s sort of intuitively intuitive or instinctive .
the model is already leaped in the womb and is intercultural , so it works around the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without most people know that this model is there .
you can see that there &apos;s about 50 to seven thousand times of us ever to activity , so in the sleep , that it &apos;s then being burned less often than there is a day .
i can now orient this mental action model , select , inform , transaction transaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , much like the metaphor of the desktops , now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a action pattern , of a action sprinkler .
and this is on a higher degree of user kindness than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktops .
and if i translate that now , for example , where i &apos;m going to orient that as overview , selective , informed as a choice , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , i can transcend it , i can throw it in or buy it somewhere .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;ll try this through an example .
everybody &apos;s eaten cake .
oversight : now i kind of interact with the object , can zoom out again , zoom in .
i get the whole overview , and i can now filter this and say , just show me all the stuff with chocolate .
and suddenly , an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the pieces , touch things , and they come up to me , is much more natural than if they can do over hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms , in a way , make these things available .
imagination is more prone , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close with you , a and a hint , also designers have to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense thank you very much for your attention and request .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing is , when you get big as a child , when you &apos;re a baby , is you take care of what the divorces you have , right ? and the more your parents allowed you to play more or less in the pottery , the more , you know , the more curiosity you &apos;ve got .
and curiosity is not learning .
that &apos;s why those of you who are here and are curious , in fact , people who have a property you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about basically this whole environmental debate , underway , 40 years of club-of-rome , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in it .
and it &apos;s phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day they give plenty of magnitude down about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to pick up two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bones .
we could only glide as an amorphan mollus across the world .
in fact , if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and abandon it .
and what &apos;s astonishing about this is that we &apos;re dealing with something that &apos;s actually self-comprehensibility , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been phosphorus for two years , and already , through phosphorus mining , we &apos;ve brought a lot more uranium into the environment than are used in all the atomic facilities .
in the last 20 years alone , fifteen thousand tons of uranium have been spread on our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , shatter the environment , drive less car .
shit the environment , make less waste .
shit the environment , use less energy .
this is not protection .
that &apos;s the way i would say , get your child , just beat it three times instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think of what the weighs to the pipe , our entire earth will become sooner or later a cemetery .
that &apos;s why we think about weighs .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all .
in the ground , over 60s percent of the carbon is stored .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or recalculating to the square meter .
that means we lose about five times more than new educated in the ground .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in openness , 20 percent of the garbage is now wind waste .
and as we grow older , wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all sort of in the subway phase .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand windmills .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
this proof , by the way , that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs over the solid ingredients .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs with this .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , right ?
we think traditional in environmental debate , we &apos;re too many around the world .
and if you reject the people who , if you tell people to exist , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , they become reef and hostile .
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , says there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilizing the human population .
in israel , if you rescued a human life , you rescued the earth .
here it says the more you change , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one likes termites , as far as they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than us .
and because they work a lot harder than us , physically , because they only live three to six months , they disagree with their weight , a little tricky billion people in energy use .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far away we are from what we really wanted to achieve and could , and how sad we are , that we are even on earth , can you see that openness has a program , for example , till twenty , you want to be here climaneutral , right ?
you can only be climaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a climaneutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be dumber than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily not , yes ?
there &apos;s no population problem with trees .
there are still six billion trees in the amazon area alone .
have you ever heard about overpopulation problems of trees ?
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be dumber than trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most strict bio-agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back into circles .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio-land , no bioland , no natural progrès , and as they all say , that allow our own excrements to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we &apos;re too many .
it certainly makes sense to be less harmful in terms of oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for business , but when it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there , right ?
nullemissions , right ?
you can only have nullemissions if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil where we regain nutrients .
we can get nutrients in agriculture in this way directly .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking the waste directly .
in china , a post-ttopian is still honeyly pottery , so to speak , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that means the whole western civilizational story is that the city has always been increasing , but farmers have never given back .
so the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers had to go to cities , and the cities had to keep moving their nutrients .
that &apos;s why all the western rich people have always expanded until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re imploded .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to get civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients back .
even today , even if they &apos;re invited to eat in china , they &apos;re expected to stay until they seek the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and to get nutrients .
they were invited to eat , not to feed theft .
that means you can see on the internet how to regain nutrients .
the really nice thing is , if you do that , you know , agriculture , produces biogas , on a hectar country with five thousand people in favelas , a farmer can produce about a thousand-dollar economy and the plant waiting for the chickens and a pig and a vegetable and a vegetable .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate goes back to favelas by over nine percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , we don &apos;t have to control people as little as possible .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the facilities carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed like this by the design that a farmer can simply farm them .
that is , the crime rates go back .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over 100 t50 years , none of these facilities have ever been sabotted .
you could throw in a liter allethal so easily , and then it would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , to be less bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do something about it , write down , in germany most suitable of all the facilities in france .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not in openness , but maybe they can help the france a little bit .
because the france plant could best regain phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it permeates .
we have now deployed in holland over three years .
the dutch government has explained that it will be the first country in the world to regain phosphorus .
but we need it overall .
you know , there are two countries that control nearly seventh percent of the phosphorus benefits in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of orphanages .
that &apos;s six and a half countries control 40 percent of the oil supplies .
and we &apos;re going to be able to replace the oil with other energy wheels .
but the phosphorus is not going to be replaced .
that &apos;s not about making the existing slightly less bad , it &apos;s about doing something right .
and most of all , it &apos;s to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand because in holland the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , if your wife is sad , if you angry her , and you come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a lip pen .
a woman in germany eats about six comma three kilograms in her lifetime .
here .
it &apos;s not scientifically accurate because we don &apos;t know how much gets kissed off .
but a lip pen , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but really effective , right ?
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
not to burn the claim a little bit better , and to defend it and to lose all the materials for cycles , but to first ask , how do you make cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; ne ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that is , everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
all the environmental debate .
we tell people , well , you don &apos;t have an environmental awareness in the south .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
every place where you throw away , from , yes , you create life opportunities .
but the wrong things .
when you throw away the wrong things , you have a problem of waste .
in how we think from the north .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
when they walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
because the soil is going to die down and the wind and the water washes the ground away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means the water &apos;s longer in meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not school management .
we say sustainability in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
so what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , heart pavement , right ?
that &apos;s the minimum right now .
so don &apos;t save , avoid .
every waste is nutrient .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , as people in the high arc are throwing out coke can from the car .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s a form of refourth behavior , right ?
you can show i was there .
but with the right design , there you go .
for example , we developed an ice scream package , which is liquid at room temperature .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , it &apos;s building all over the place .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that by throwing away biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful at all .
so there are two cycles that come .
not everything should be composable , of course .
a tv station or a washing machine , because they just use it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that are wasting , like shoe soles , like brakes , like authors , they must be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only being used go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
like the sneaker , right ?
very direct advertising , not for the company puma per se , but for helping this company make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to eat and say that &apos;s free of crops , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we determined what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all inside , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes with which you can put the carcel start at the pedestrian pole and the rubber can go into biological cycles , right ?
all of these are composable of them .
and of course , when we do it , we do it for adidas , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and all the textile industry .
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s sewage problems caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you help with it , ask for people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed the chairman twice now .
and i &apos;m not sure they really stay there .
so , help me with this a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s just been shown .
you can .
we can make things like this now that if they give away , if they break , they can flow in biological circles .
technical cycles are the same .
there &apos;s a direct feedback system for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , which is actually made to go back into the circulation .
that too , so in every store you can get things back .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the angle again ?
now , when it &apos;s the waste .
all over the place , these winds are close .
in the countries where people come to money .
it &apos;s on the deposit , but it &apos;s also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside , that you can just go back to cellulosic basis , you can plant 100 trees with a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
just when you take these gears , you shrink , sterilize and you take the powder to plant trees .
so the baby is carbon positive for all life , from the very beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be climaneutral , we can be climate positive .
it &apos;s sort of a foggy poop print .
yeah , so to speak .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started an institute on this .
now , a lot of people work there , and they can all engage .
there &apos;s extra clubs to cradle to cradle , where everybody can join .
so no longer save , avoid , reduce , not debt management , but intelligent waste .
does this matter ?
thank you .
the work of interpreting it .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i said that as an interpreter , i am an interpreter , so in english word sense , i understand .
interprets are translators of the written notes in clinical music .
not only do you translate the word for word into another language , but you also have to understand the deeper sense of the words and word bias so that there is a useful translation , anyone who has to do with foreign languages .
translation from germans into english can require more knowledge , once you think about poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s freely for layas to what we do with our music language to musicians .
as an interpreter of a piece of music , i first have just the written notes .
you think the composer has put everything into the notes , which he came up with .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
these notes are about the same , or inaccurate as a verbal , even though very seemingly penious , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape description , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the green , not to hear the column of the wind , not feel .
that means that the interpreter has to translate this inexhaustible sequence of notation into another , namely audible , concrete , nonverbal music language .
today i want to translate to you what else i &apos;m doing , which is interpreting , again , into a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i prefer to do the whole thing in german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be important for me to translate the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me the same as spoken language .
the notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to just learn to read notes and press the keys on the piano or the right place on a violin string .
because these would be just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letters you only see when you can make the language .
so for the learning process of music , you need at least as long as spoken language .
there are also subtractions , whether you can learn it for use , just passively understands or actively speaking to the musical native native speaker .
the work of interpreting starts kind of like a theater director course .
after you first chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you study for backgrounds of composition .
you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
you read them in the letters , the journals , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of composers themselves .
you study the work he &apos;s composed before and after .
you compare them .
the cause of writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
what were its circumstances , like society and politics ?
i &apos;m interested in all this .
you &apos;re thinking in that time by looking at contemporary images , for example , or reading literature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also been interpreted as a rich knowledge to feel the composer you &apos;re playing more often , and it &apos;s getting easier and easier to come in and feel inside .
the composer becomes more and more a friend that you live with .
his cause of writing the piece becomes increasingly and more about my personal cause to play it .
now that the notes are anything but an accurate record of the composer , but a framework , i &apos;m now turning this scaffold to replenish it with meaning and meaning .
so i say in my own words , what could be written between this scaffold ?
i &apos;m explaining what these sounds might have to mean .
now for me and for the composer back then , and what you might mean now for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself because it comes out of my right now .
it has to be coherent to me and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s a very happy concert over and over again , if i may have the experience , the play that i &apos;ve been working in advance as long as i can experience new .
as you see a happy new day , although with the same rituals of life , they get up , they go to work , i do the same thing over and over again .
i &apos;m older again , changing seasons , my pulse goes slower in the morning , in a concert room it takes longer for the sound to come back than at home .
i &apos;m realizing the audience &apos;s breathing , consciously or unconscious .
all this influences me and all of this also affects my experience with composition .
and it &apos;s wonderful when i &apos;m standing on stage with a duo partner , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , appropriate conversation .
you bring a new idea in , and that &apos;s how it gets answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we haven &apos;t tried so well and you can &apos;t sample .
it &apos;s great fun to make music this way , and then as the audience , you have experienced the music communicating alive .
so each concert is a different concert .
i &apos;m never going to play the same as this moment .
i can &apos;t play the way i play today in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore i &apos;m going to have a lot more color chances of emotions and emotions than we have today .
surely , i &apos;m going to throw out some color pots as well , but get new ones .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a piano cursus for music students in my beloved old teacher , professor jelt ude , a well-known beethoven-specialist , concert pianist and long-term professor of music college here in student school .
unfortunately , i was too young so that when i finally started studying it .
but i was very lucky to meet him at age three , and so i was already in his classes at the time of high school .
i was seventh when i went back to one of his classes and played the last of the four ballads of chopin , a late piece .
he asked me what was the introduction of this ballad for me .
it &apos;s such a contracted part .
and in my adolescence , i said expectation .
that &apos;s when he was crushing and like , &quot; so ? &quot;
that must be the difference of aging .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over 60s .
well , with seventh , you have dreams , but no significant memories .
i play the piece today every few years , and it &apos;s changed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because over and over again i read something new .
an example of this from a very different area . monet painted the seerosis x-times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different days , in different light .
he transferred the roses in a different way , as he saw them , as they worked on him at that moment .
his personal impressions of the sea eroses .
the x-former interpretation of a piece is comparable to that .
by now , i &apos;m older than chopin , at age two and a half , when he wrote that piece .
he lived only nine and a half years .
and it &apos;s important for me to look into the notes over and over again , even though i think i can memorize them .
to keep twin practices right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection with him .
especially when it &apos;s already died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , it takes about as long as spoken language to do .
you know , often the music class is that you first learn to read the notes .
you learn to read practically first before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers are in time and right the way the notes are moving , then sound comes out , sounds together like music .
when that happens faillessly , the student gets the next hard piece .
interpretation is barely spoken in early education .
all right , there &apos;s a quick piece in the front of the presto .
lento , slow .
loud and headmark , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
but even if you translate that information , it remains just a little bit of technical .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very basic .
namely , to make music on the instrument , to do its own musical do and feel present before .
that &apos;s singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn singing because it didn &apos;t pretend to parents , it won &apos;t do it by itself .
it &apos;s like learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , and then have it over another way to sound about an instrument .
people who &apos;ve never felt anything that &apos;s immediate with their own body , like making a sound .
making a phrase with its own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our bodies .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
melody comes from the healthy and the rhythm from the dance .
the enduring report today with music is not there .
you don &apos;t need to make music yourself if it gets boring .
no longer need to whistle or sing a loan .
every single music is being made when you &apos;re constantly sued by the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i ask you , can &apos;t you sing a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to see if they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , right ?
you can train that .
or c , because they &apos;ve cleaned it to them , they &apos;re intractable .
and then i ask , how peer-competent was this diagnosis ?
have you already gotten a second or third opinion , as you say today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you want to have nix .
but what i would regret then , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can still disagree with them .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be an exceptional candidate .
but please don &apos;t say anything , i don &apos;t understand classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody says it doesn &apos;t know if it tastes to me because i can &apos;t cook .
now , they &apos;re not cooking because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to cite classical music either because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and say whether it tastes to you or not .
whether the music is too whistled or too sweet .
tell what you feel .
over time , you get sprayed , and you want some more spices to urge or even taste fine differences .
why am i now asking my audience to actively listen ?
because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
an artwork you never look at has no force to work .
the food that was cooked by a chef or a chef needs to be eaten and not only looked at or swapped out of recipes .
so please listen when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
if in an environment where adults make actively music , or at least listen to active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flower have ?
can you play them in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a memorial , instead of having a red flower before .
and that sounds very different than before .
that was the very first start of a musical expression .
so the first step in an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , two hundred , or even three hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have progressed .
there was no piano as an instrument at all .
it just wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would have been thrilled if he had had the sound possibility of today &apos;s modern piano .
i can now sound the notions that the stream has had on the modern wing to sound what a baroque cembalo cannot do .
beethoven also you know he heard more than he had already turned deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra has rejected from then as unplay .
so the composers rely on us interprets that reinvent the pieces .
so they can be heard , which they &apos;ve just come up in the mind .
and also , what you would think today in your mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
have you ever been jewish ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
when i come , with my little v piesel and i &apos;m wrong , that feeling comes up .
i &apos;m shooting something through my head .
i say , ulf , what &apos;s the big car you need ?
that &apos;s actually half his value in the first year .
and anyway , you work much less than me .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
and then i come to mind immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward feeling away .
our organism has invented a great way of making such inconvenient feelings as envy simply to disappear .
you can try it with words like revenge or winning or something .
i want to explain something to you today about this mechanism , or something that you &apos;re unaware of .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you might have heard it when people say no one has an intent to build a wall .
and then he towers stones up so he can lock them up .
you see at such a lie that the liar itself doesn &apos;t believe what it says .
it &apos;s very easy to see that it &apos;s very different in mind .
it &apos;s just fooling you and not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with fooling yourself .
you need that lie to sustain a lie to sustain self-deception .
they can make them less easy , yes , check , or even bring them down .
you need time .
from that time , an anecdote you may know .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once portrayed a woman .
this woman then complained that the portrait wouldn &apos;t look like her .
picasso answers , just wait .
they &apos;re getting more and more similar .
at this point and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to know something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a disconnected relationship with lying .
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is telling you something in such a portrait that you &apos;re only going to become familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this artwork over and over again .
and then that awkward feeling disappears , because it doesn &apos;t look like you and it &apos;s getting more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lifestyle .
and not only in art , but in volcanic classes , in mythology , in stories , it appears again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful thing in the country ?
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility comes out of that true outcome , even the mirror cannot lie from that true outcome .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand with political policing over and over again .
we need this lie at this point that holds us on deception without which we can &apos;t even live .
not only do we have in art , in volksmic poetry , but also in science such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bischop of word chester .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and human ancestry .
that the human being should come from the monkeys and , yes , there would be at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran up to her husband and said that &apos;s probably not true what charles wrote .
the human being is supposed to come from the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people from getting knowledge of it .
why do we have to stop people getting knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
because without these livelihoods we can &apos;t live .
because we have this self-delusion , this sense of being great , descent of the highest beings , not of such a natural level , of something unpredictable like an organism that still exists to make a stone comparable and otherwise , which is unsustainable for us .
so , we can &apos;t make these things at all .
we need to stop people getting knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism resolves and what the traces it leaves behind , leading to something different than this great picture of ourselves , i want to get you to another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told about a student .
an autistic student .
she likes him especially because he has a slope for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire service .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re hotter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral justification is using the word , we should try to replace it with the word .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the outcome .
this is a little bub that doesn &apos;t care about fire solving .
he &apos;s interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no clubs to which we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
there he signed up .
and besides that , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to put fires anywhere and be happy when the fire comes up afterwards .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of cleaning the dangers , the others create when they lay fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this suggestion that inside the bub had already known that it was actually related to fire , but he can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious one that is going on right away without the fact that you can do something about it , and the things you know look very different , designed to sound much better for you and others .
so just those words that we &apos;re using over and over again in the language of politically correct speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know , when we say that , social relations are very delicate .
we can &apos;t do that simply .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that should work .
so let me show you what we found at my institute .
according to the logic , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in unconscious ways that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example requires what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such a thing as a mental thing , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not gavc , material nature .
and if you have people who are persuasive that they have a soul , or you can also say , they think they &apos;ve been brought from the soul to life , then they think it &apos;s kind of , like the soul , a spiritual framework , not from the earth , from them .
and so , from that soul , you think that somehow in this cloudy nature , in this funny nature , anima , it &apos;s in latin , which is present .
and then , when this magnificent object pops over people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live with soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of what the soul does .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the human .
so we need to perceive them as something that is supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have this prediction in front of you , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing this happiness through a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
three of them still know from school .
this is now a three-sentence that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but you also need to lie the willingness .
and that is , lying so that you can just get this logic wrong .
there are three sentences in that three-sentence .
the first sentence is clear , there are no soul .
so the second sentence is , if sound is right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i highlighted him in particular here .
a third sentence that appears immediately in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who has no soul , who is dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and that &apos;s where you feel it .
here comes this logic in this , yes , in this deceptive talk , to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
because i can say anything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a point about reality .
i can say the instructor is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the instructor is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the instructor is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say anything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s right .
so if sound says there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our fooling mind feels instantly , and you can make something out of it .
it adds up a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and pretends to be the opposite of the first sentence already proven and assumed .
because we actually have to prove whether or not there &apos;s the soul .
but with this logic , which simply uses two sentences to be reasonably correct , and a third one that looks like he &apos;s having something to do with it , so we can save our livelihoods .
so , we pretend it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example that keeps filling daycare newspapers .
this is another philosophical topic , a permanent burning from philosophy , is present .
this has to do with going back to the fourth century .
there was a scholar named johannes buridanus , and after that , the buridansche esel named .
the buridanese esel is an esel made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have these soul .
this is such a natural thing .
and if you place the exact thing in the middle between two equally large haves , he &apos;s hungry .
because he doesn &apos;t know which haystack to go to first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how nature presents things .
equally large forces with current signs dissolve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if it makes a haystack larger immediately , it doesn &apos;t need reason and it doesn &apos;t need anything .
automatically , he walks to the right mind .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , determined by the larger pile that attracts you immediately , then you also quickly feel that there must be something like free will .
and if we &apos;re already here in france at the main , i remember the max planck institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a scholar called wolf singer , and they sometimes say wolf singer , there &apos;s no freedom for free .
now we can make the second sentence again and say , if wolf singer is right , he has no freedom for free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper , find that in that third sentence .
it looks something like this , who has no freedom of will not be able to be attracted to his actions and claims of responsibility , and therefore unaccountable .
here you have it again .
actually , the first thing you have to do is prove whether there &apos;s such a thing as free .
but the logic of deception allows us to pretend that the first sentence of forward is wrong , of course , as if you had to assume the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything yourself if you want to test anything yourself , and particularly if you want to make people happy , you can practice that courage to lie .
practice , for example , once you meet a human being that you can say , there are no predictors .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predictors , which is called prophet .
you cannot call that , that would be a little bit politically incorrect .
you know , there are no predictors .
immediately they will experience one that , of course , such predictors , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you already have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy trying to make sure you can &apos;t prove that there are no predictors , the man is quite happy .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he fooled them .
because he led it to a fiber where he doesn &apos;t stop himself from .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free from the need to prove that there are predictors .
so , in the kind of shifting the burden of evidence , you &apos;re experiencing the brilliance of lying .
and once again , if you have such a way to feel that three-sentence in other people , you do it because you will make others happy if you don &apos;t remember them that way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i allowed myself to ask lilly if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the performers here from this great event , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and give my idea price .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it with me , it was hard to talk about my idea at first .
and i may imagine my island project , i &apos;m trying to introduce you to .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum full , lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably hearing these nice two girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has been looking for this bad oko image because i &apos;ve already started studying machine construction in carlbou , technical school , i think , today .
and then i moved to berlin in the mid-80s because i wanted to do renewable energy , and it didn &apos;t exist in karlshe .
there was leopoldshaped at the core research plant .
they were all called kfa at the time , and the jewish was called kfa .
they are now projectors .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but something like &apos; n solar pendulum that comes out of the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful to the premium cola person that he rehabilitated the word again because after the masonry , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything on the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the early days .
there was just one of them that was self-administered alternative operations , and one of them was sitting in cross mountain in the multi-yard where you suspected the evil .
the place of terrorism , but that was called the bold bars and wind and solar , and that &apos;s where i started in the mid-80s .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve been told today touches me very , because many , many beautiful expressions were in the process that i &apos;ve lived through .
i worked in the collective for 11 years , which was grassroots democratic .
we were 20 people .
when one said no , the vetoprinzip was that completely crushed you , and for 10 years , i &apos;ve struggled to see if i &apos;ve wasted my great engineering study maybe really to make a weak thing , because all my colleague &apos;s money , you &apos;ve always spoken to him .
it &apos;s about meaning .
and this was really , really bitter , and you also come into this phase , and it just showed up a picture where i asked myself for 10 years , thousands of d marrow , which was then , base wages , collectively , if this should be really great .
and then i stopped till six and a half and a half , and then along with friends , we became the co-founder of the company solon , which became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world with spin-off q.
a huge story of success , but again , we have the problem of a growing entrepreneur , and then we have two-thousandth , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start again and go back and look at the next topic of the future , and that means , i think , that &apos;s crazy .
and here i brought you a project i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to get 100 percent renewable .
and we &apos;ve just started asking a relatively simplistic crazy story , where could you use a memory meaningful today ?
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azors .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
that &apos;s five percent renewable energy share today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
it just doesn &apos;t work technologically .
when they &apos;re growing more wind power to each other , the system starts to fail .
i always tell the politicians that when they occupy our facility in berlin adler shard .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , does it calculate two-thousandth of 2006 , started the first contacts with the island , just run through it .
how big a battery would have to be , in fact , to get an island like this to 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even seventh percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go another slide .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electrical performance are built on the same basis in the world .
this is the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s particularly quick everywhere .
the world &apos;s energy hunger , which is happening , is wiped out with this , because you don &apos;t need permission .
it &apos;s fast .
you put a box like this .
and then it usually looks like this .
and over the course of three of these , two of them are always waited .
yeah , this is what one looks like down there is the burden .
we also got very detailed data .
and the wind power plant , or whatever it is , is usually a back-up system , or a system that can only store in small quantities here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
this is going to get back-up and wind , and the sun &apos;s burden so they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off this one .
that means , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables can sort of take over the web .
of course , you can only do that if you &apos;re manned in some way here .
no one has done that in the world .
that &apos;s a little style , so you can also use your razors in the car over a little switch judge .
people always ask me , what do you actually do research in adler shard ?
that &apos;s already happening .
but if you want to gather up multiple of these conversations and build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was to get to seventh to nine percent renewable , and then remain that rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , is going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
it &apos;s certainly going to be a energy system , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or table , that will be it .
so you have to go more to a seasonal memory and compensate winter summer and not just tag-night .
we just wanted to know what about a normal electrochemical battery .
how far do you get ?
and then did a whole bunch of simulation .
and they simulated wind and sun and the burden and came to the conclusion , a very exciting result that , after 20 years , you have to get out of the conventional system at about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour at about 40 cents per mile .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the same system if the same price goes up five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the insulin landers .
what would all have to be done ?
i negotiated with investors , i searched new social sheep .
we were only five people then to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the representation again .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
now , our system also has a price rise is that we &apos;re still going to do 20 percent with this , and we &apos;re not going to go through a price increase in the other things .
and the power-utility , which is the power utility company on the island , is what we love to find .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a halle in berlin where we could sort of map the electric rate of the island of one to three very precisely .
that is , we went for the first time to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
this comes naturally from asia , where the trap is from japan .
and funny , in the &apos; 70s , it was developed at bbc mannheim , today , and then executed to the japanese .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery you can see .
it &apos;s got a megawatt power , and it can get that power for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of got out of simulation .
and then they set them up .
we also have one of these same aggregate that he &apos;s standing there , put it in the hall to actually simulate the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the half-way now , there &apos;s this el at the back here , there &apos;s the big battery that we &apos;re all around the web .
over here , we simulate the whole transmission system , the kilometer physics of cable , to sort of map the vibrational behavior on the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics onto the net .
here we see this again , this again , the whole , individual aggregate .
and what we &apos;ve done since two-thousandth was the neck finished , until today , two thousandth of all that was between the individual system of electronics to develop software , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not a battery maker , we &apos;re defining ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the subject of battery and the topic and everything in between .
you &apos;ve got to communicate to the battery , of course , you &apos;ve got to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is , on this island , you can basically take away everything that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion of how to move back and forth right now , energy turn , how to go , on the island , we have , for example , five to 30 percent accurate energy energy , so we &apos;re tilting the wind and the sun .
natural light then offers smart grid .
so smart-grid , a huge subject everywhere .
we can start to integrate electromobility on the island , ask about , because you can manage the burden .
that is , if you &apos;re seven percent renewable , you &apos;re not going to be able to do that without memory .
you can hear by &apos; n smart-grid , you can do that by expanding the nets , yes , you should definitely do that , but you will never be able to completely dispense on memory .
and this is the n bite the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn off this el , you don &apos;t have this spinning mass that causes certain inertia on the web .
and our european network is basically just made out of loud rotating masses of big power plants , wherever the wave goes all over europe .
we look in this web , we see the 50th hertz , and when it becomes nine hertz nine , we catch up some valves , then a little bit of a merh goes in , we come back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible work .
if you tear it down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spider reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , you can react to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , that rotating mass , you have to replace that with productivity electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can turn two milliseconds into it with this big battery .
and you can see that there are enormous speed opportunities .
and the message is , we need to get those rotating masses , if we kind of twenties , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach them at all .
then we have to tear off our must-run capacity on the net .
must-run means the power plant is just running to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a huge debate right now , because we don &apos;t have any power plants , or gastries , because it &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can break down the capacity , the must-run capacity by putting electrochemical storage on the net as well .
now , fortunately , there are a whole lot of studies for that .
and to that purpose , people always come and look at our experimentation , sort of our island test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take away a piece of future ?
and many discussions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years have been similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years on photovoltaics .
don &apos;t go , it &apos;s insane , it &apos;s child play , it &apos;s all we calculated , never calculate .
we have 30 gigawatts today photovoltaics in germany .
this is pre-model .
and i just think that in the next 30 years we &apos;ll have the same capacity for electrochemical storage all over the world .
very simple , this is how it &apos;s going to come .
there will be a whole bunch of resistance and arguments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve been experiencing , in the last two years , the scientists are going to step on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million funding projects now to climb 10 megawatt-battery now to the german net .
this will take place next april .
so , from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that defense to that , to that idea , a hundred percent renewable yes .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like an austeal system .
so far , in discussions , this insulin laner is always trying to do something like this : they have a own little net , which has nothing to do with our connection .
the question is , quite simply , if you &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or uranium energy that &apos;s drilled out anywhere in the world and then you &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s available to the sun and the wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a reasonable energy supply , and i &apos;m cradle to cradle also grateful that they said , use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and insofar , the talk of premium kola , is that you can be a collective and use solar energy again , put together a little bit .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to be a little crazy , and also have a vision .
and you really have to be pretty tough about it , but i think it &apos;s going to work .
thank you .
when steve lopez , colomnist of the los angeles times , went through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathetic , rau , homeless , who played on a violin that had only two more strings .
many of you will know the story , because from steven &apos;s article later became a book that was filmed with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx was a nathaniel anthony ayers who ended up studying his juvenile career in a multiplic-conservative way .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless people on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend reading steves &apos;s book , or looking at the film , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that occurred between these two men , but also how music helped make that connection and how it was the instrument when that word game is allowed to get the althane off the street .
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , when walt disney is a hall .
he &apos;d just heard a demonstration of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never get it into the baseball series , and all of this because of the dory passage of the first stage of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email that said that nathaniel was interested in me in education of their own .
i have to mention that nathaniel rejected a medical treatment because he had already been treated with electric shocks and with thorazine and trails , a trauma that followed him all his life .
as a consequence of this , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes away in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and torture quals of his own mind .
and in this same kind of rice stage , nathaniel was when we started with our first lesson in walt disney hall . he had this insane fleeting in his eyes and worked completely out .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in the sleep .
i was afraid , not because of my opinion , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could fall into one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship with the violin if i started talking about claims and arpeggios and other exciting shapes of the diacedos .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i realized that there was a whole change going on in nathanite &apos;s eyes .
it was like he was standing under the impact of an invisible drug znei , a chemical response that catalyst was my game .
nathanite &apos;s manic anger turned into understanding , into a quiet curiosity and gratitude .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and began playing some clips of violin inconcert , and then asked me to finish it : mendelsson , tshaicowski , sibelius .
we then started talking about music from bach to beethoven , brahms , bruckers and all the other bs , from bartok to esa-pecca .
and i realized , not only did he possess an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but connected it to her a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i otherwise know about my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , this paranoid , confused man who &apos;d just moved through the streets of los angeles , became a dear , trained , excellent , in juilliard trained musician .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for nathaniel , music means blurry health .
because the music allows him to reform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he escapes his torturing conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that &apos;s why we make music : so that we can put something inside us all , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to really shape .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves , inspired and united us .
what nathaniel did was bring him back to a community of friends .
the disinspiring power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood his talent and saw him .
and i &apos;m going to keep playing with nathaniel , whether walt disney is a hall or scid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve unfortunately stolen the cellist .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
that first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , tastier , good consistency , rich , pollinator on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was grown in aquaculture after the most precise standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day the head of the company called and asked if i could do this at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem became for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our menu ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tunas , the healing butt , the smiling , heavy fish , they have collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably or lush aquulture , fish chances , will be part of our future .
many arguments against it . fishermen pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a score from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wildfish are necessary to get a pound of sugar tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of public work for the company .
don &apos;t call him .
don , i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollut the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world of ourselves .
this forage from 2.5 to 1 , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and that night i was lying in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i telephones with a few people in the company , and nobody could give me a proper answer , until i finally started with the led biologist telephones .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish meals , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone flour , refined , dried and forged . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much of your food is chicken ? &quot;
in thinking of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about having chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-esteem and good person .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually fell in love with this fish because i swear to god who tasted fish after this conversation after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way in which the better you know your fish , the more you love the fish .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of journalists had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it kind of wired us up .
he came to the table with a bright , almost immune white color .
the chef cooked it .
hold twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after it &apos;s been cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fish rising in the southwestern corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the coin of the river guadalquivir .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
they were growing meat cattle on what was basically wetlands .
they did that by dewatering the country .
they built this complicated series of channels , and they urged water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make the difference , not economic .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds about what many birds are for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company with environmental consciousness bought the country .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of water .
they &apos;ve literally transformed the lever .
instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to remove the water .
they flew the canals .
they created a 11,000 hectares of fish -- bark , sea branches , garnels , aal -- and miguel and his company completely reversed ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen this before .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are curved channels and those density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t there very long ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile for kissing . &quot;
okay ? we were there , and we fought through the wetlands , and i &apos;m beating and sweating , and i have matsch to my knees , and miguel is going to rest a biology lecture .
here he is highlighting a rare railway .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , he sees a pattern of bundles reminding him of the tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out miguel has spent most of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more rarely birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , like that .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish that i had in the evening .
so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; miguel , how is your fish so good ? &quot;
he pointed at the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
what &apos;s the use of food ? &quot;
well , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-enduring .
there &apos;s no food .
the farm your animals don &apos;t feed ?
later that day , i was driving around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a film director was demanding a change in time .
and we bent around the corner , and we had the most incredible look at it , thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingo , literally a pinker carpet so far .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your stomach , pink .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
bad ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you blow your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds .
well , last year , on this site , 600,000 birds , were over 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private aviation reservations across europe today .
i said , &quot; miguel , is a well-deived bird not the last thing you want to do on a fish ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re growing existential , not intensely .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
so the more pink the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals and a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators .
a fish rising , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city of 2,000 miles away , where the ground quality is better for nest maintenance .
every morning they fly 2,000 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly back 2,000 miles .
they do that because they can follow the painted white line on the street a92 .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of trip to the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , are you flying 400 miles to the farm and then flying back to the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me like i &apos;d just quoted a song by whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it clean . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this scary , cooked taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t look at fish skin at all .
she tasted sweet and pure as if you were to take a bite off the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was nodding .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to uncertainty . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no units . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have any uncertainty , he undergoes tremendous because the water that flows through this farm comes from the river guadalquivir .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are happening now tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , abundance of pest control .
and when it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves the water clean than how it came from .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that feeds its animals , not just a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a water treatment plant , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as romantic as it is , is also recording .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future for good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bark or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one where food actually tastes good .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not realists , we enjoy . we &apos;re lovers .
we love weekmarkets . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat bio .
and if you say that these are the things that infiltrate the future of good food somewhere , someone stands up and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pinke flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just .
a billion people are going to starve today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser inequalities in distribution , not overall production .
well , i don &apos;t like that question , because she has determined the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
feet of crops on herbivores , pest irrigation tools for monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and the whole time the agribusiness simply asks , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was justification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what they are , a commercial in involved , a commercial that eats rapidly ecological capital that enables that production .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cornchamber is now threatened not by degrading , but by degrading resources .
not the latest stress and tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chainsaw , but through forests , and not fishing boats and networks , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in there , and it &apos;s never really producing good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what comes back to two billion years of labor experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not only worlds for themselves to restore rather than using them , operations that grow existential , farmers that are not only generators , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i ever will be .
you know , that &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to close one thing to you today , it &apos;s that the total amount of data we consume has gotten bigger than the sum of its parts and instead of thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information to be so that patterns and so we don &apos;t recognize trends .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical mortality diagram of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is filter after a certain cause of death , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that comes out .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of this , people are the most active , and they &apos;re most calculated over here .
we can step further out and rearrange the data and see that circular disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , as we move on and sort of age , we say 40 years or younger , we see accidents are even the main cause for people to worry about .
and whoever sees it , it &apos;s particularly true for men .
so you realize that looking at information and data in this way reminds very much of swimming in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not content itself ?
so what we have here are the front pictures of every single sports illustroke that have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in your room .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into one particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this encore and the sports species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on this and show all the expenses that lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a bigger overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything about bicycling ? &quot;
so i go one step back and i get the view .
now i see greg lemoon .
and so you get an idea that if you go through this kind of information , targeted , broader , zoom in , zoom out , you don &apos;t just search or surf .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little bit further with something like what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we did here is we took every single wikipediaser and we reduced it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short overview and a symbol of the area where it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wikipediasites .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of &quot; government . &quot;
now , after i chose government , i know that the wikipediacatories that are the most covering time magazine &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaste .
that &apos;s only to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
looking at one particular of these summaries , then i can go into the theme of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everybody together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials . some come from science . some , some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we surf on the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring this zoom-technology to every single website like this .
so i can step back and jump right to a specific section .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because you can only look at websites in this way , the whole internet course in the same way .
so i can zoom in on my trajectory in a certain time .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve given to this .
and i can sort of repeat anything i &apos;ve seen today .
and , if i go out and look at everything again , i may rearrange my path to my search past . here , i looked for &apos; nepotistic &apos; here for bing , or here for live labs .
and from here , i can go into the site and recall them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the whole picture bigger than the sum of the data .
right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around and turn the internet upside down so that instead of always going from one to another , we can start to go from many things , and see what kind of hidden patterns would have otherwise remained ?
if we can do that , this sort of data trap that &apos;s going to become a new source of meaningful information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can even pull grain from it .
i &apos;ll stop with that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a hearing portion of science fiction .
in my school time , i went to school on the bus , an hour per day .
and my nose was always in a book , a science-fiction book that satisfied my thoughts in other worlds , and in a narrative , my deep in my seats , insatiable curiosity .
and this curiosity also showed that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , i would wander and gather samples and frogs and snakes and fluids and dough water all home watching under the microscope .
i was totally science enthusiastic , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to resist in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
i think that &apos;s been very good at this science fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was neither video games nor this overseation of computer-generated films or the entire media landscape imagery , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book as children , we took the description of the author and tried it on the screen in our heads .
my reaction to this was to draw and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , spaceships and all that kind of thing .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , like me , hiding behind the textbook , painting around .
creativity somehow had to go out .
and something interesting happened , because what fascinated me about jacques cousteau &apos;s shows was the idea of a totally unknown world here on earth itself .
i certainly would never reach an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all the things i had always imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , to be a diver .
the only problem with this is that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand kilometers away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let myself discourage about that .
i buffalo , until he finally exited a dive school in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my submersible in a pool of the ymca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later on to face when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years that have been failing now , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , 500 hours of that in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as rich as fascinating life as we can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination does not know borders , unlike our own , clear human imagination .
to this day i feel deep awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love for ocean keeps , with the same intensity as eh and ever .
so when i went out as an adult , it was a filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i kept drawing comic books and stuff .
so movies were the way to bring together pictures and stories . the fit together .
of course , the stories i chose were the science-fiction field : &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
at &quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to connect my preference to the underwater world and diving to the filmmaking .
so basically my two passions were intertwining .
something interesting happened at abyss : to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and that is , we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we went on computer-generated animation , cg , back .
and what came out was the first computer-generated software surface-figure ever to see in a movie .
now , the film didn &apos;t bring in any money , in fact , it just played out its cost of production , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that ran out of it .
arthur clarke &apos;s law , famously , is no longer to distinguish advanced technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , this has to be involved in film art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with ilm , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success depended on how this effect would arrive .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played a little bit more money with the film .
of those two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for filmmaking .
so i started a company with my good friend stan winston , who was the best makeup and creature-designer at that time called digital domain .
the basic idea of this company was to skip the phase analog processes with optical printers and start with digital productions .
we did that , and we created a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the mid-1990s , we realized that we were starting in creature- and fancy design -- which we actually started the company , too slowly .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measurements of visual effects and computer-generated effects all over new heights with realistic human , expressive characters made by cg , and the main figures should all be cg and the world .
but the knife pole hit quite nicely , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet able to do that .
so i shifted that and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship . &quot; it became a love film of epan extent , a passionate movie .
but secret , i really wanted to go down to the real wreck of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced you by saying , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the wreck . we &apos;re filming the real wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good salesman for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this comes back to the fact that your imagination can make a reality .
we then actually created a reality six months later in which i found myself in a russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bull-eye .
this was not a movie , no hd , this was real .
so that blew me up .
and the preparation for that was enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and i realized how much these deep sea distances looked like a space mission .
well , they were also highly technical and durable .
you get into this capsule , you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t go back yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like i &apos;m in a science fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature where we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in thermal vents , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for science at the time when we saw it , there had no words yet .
so i was really blown away , and i wanted more .
and so i then made a little unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice and i &apos;m going to do full-time researchers for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we went to the bismarck , and we explored them with robotic experiences .
we returned to the wreck of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that wrapped up a fiberglass cable .
our purpose was to dive in and look inside the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wreck . you didn &apos;t have any means for it . so we developed the technology that you need .
now , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , and i &apos;m looking at planks that are pretty similar to these brakes here , and i know once played the band there .
and i fly with a little robotic experience through the hallway of the ship .
i &apos;m actually just praying it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the shipwreck of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a déjan yelling vu i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i drill around a corner at each time , i always knew what was about to appear in the light cone of the vehicle because i was walking through the movie set for months .
the set was actually an accurate copy of the blueprint of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this telepresence experience that you can use robotic avatars like this , and so your consciousness can put into your vehicle into this other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little bit of a glimpse of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things in all sorts of post-human-to-future scenarios that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
after these expeditions , we started to really appreciate what we saw down there , for example , these deep sources where we saw these incredibly amazing animals -- these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a solar light system like we do .
and so you see animals right next to 500 degrees celsius saying they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was the science-fiction impact from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who have to do with nasa and sit in the nasa expert commitment and plan real space missions . they go to russia , they go through the mission to the biomedical protocols and they take the international space station .
that was fascinating .
but in the end , it turned out that i took space scientists with us to the deep sea .
i took them with me and sheep them access to the world at the bottom : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people interested in those extreme situations , and i took them to the sources for them to look around and test instruments and so on .
now we did documentary films , but actually done science , in particular , space science .
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , and the implementation to reality .
in the course of this voyage of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you must now think a director must also lead , be a leader like a ship captain or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say to myself , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of that ? &quot;
these silly movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of production . don &apos;t go from fame .
everybody thinks i &apos;d gone off between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i &apos;d been celebrating somewhere on a towel on the beach .
i made all these films , these documentary films for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you do it by the task of will , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you do . you make it the discoverable way , and because of the weird connection that comes from a small group of people forming a team .
because we did all this with just 10 to 12 people who worked uninterrupted for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing to do is to take care of one another , because you &apos;ve copied a task that you can &apos;t explain to another .
if you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound weakness , and all the technology around it , and all the difficulty , the human capacity , if you &apos;re working in the lake , you can &apos;t explain it . it &apos;s like the policemen , it &apos;s never done .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to make my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same type of leadership , which is that you respect your team and you deserve on the contrary of that respect .
this really changed the dynamic .
so i stood there with a small team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that had not been there before .
incredibly exciting .
a massive challenge .
and we became a real family for four and a half years .
it completely changed my way of making films .
there were people who thought we &apos;d really done these ocean creatures well and transported them on the planet pandora .
for me , it was a principle of doing my job , the actual process that changed .
so what can we conclude from all this ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think first of all , curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and your team &apos;s attention is more important than any lorbeer in the world .
i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice of how to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restrict yourself .
get others to you . don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself . take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and in exploring , failure must be an alternative , because it guarantees that trusted .
no major endeavor that required innovation was ever approached without risk .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to leave you with . failures is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my full-time job at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , to make the things we have to invent and deliver to allow the poorest 2 billion to live better .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than anyone on the planet .
climate change degradation means that the speakers will not grow over many years . it will rain too much or too little . things will change the way that their fragile environment cannot maintain .
this leads to starvation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and then the energy episode for them is very important .
in fact , if you could only reduce price by one thing , the poverty reduction would be the most effective energy .
well , the energy episode has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
coal evolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in electricity , and so we have refrigerators , climate plants , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce price -- let &apos;s halve the price -- we hit a new barrier , and that barrier is related to co2 .
co2 warms the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they consume the stolen co2 that leads to temperature , and that increase in temperature has some very negative effects . effects on weather and perhaps worse , indirect that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt so rapidly to change and therefore whole systems collapse .
well , the exact relationship between a co2 rise and the results of temperature change and where the other consequences are , there are some ambiguity , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a quarter enough ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will go up .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying we have a 3.5 foot high truck that needs to be under a three-foot bridge , and then you can kind of squeeze it underneath .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we release a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american people about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that will reduce that to zero .
it &apos;s up constant .
only different economic changes have affected it at all , and we need to go from rapid to increase and reduce to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that will depend on the number of people that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service and carbon per unit that &apos;s emitted .
so let &apos;s look at every factor and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s heading towards nine billion , moving to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 to 15 percent , but right now we see a slope for 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes all the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reduction means making these services available to almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably strike and use less , but on average , that number will rise every year and therefore double more than doubt , the number of services that are being provided per person .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so that you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their school problems under the streets .
well , in efficiency , the e that makes energy per service , there &apos;s good news finally .
we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other autotypes , through new ways of building buildings , there are many services that make some individual services reduce by 90 percent .
in other services , like fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 05 : 56,000 -- &amp; lt ; 00 : 05 : 58,000 or air transport or air transport , the playspace for improvement is much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor three or maybe even by a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is emitted per unit of energy .
it &apos;s asking if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity today emitts co2 , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do at a global level is create a new system .
we need energy miracles .
now when i use the term &quot; miracles , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
people here contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to have a particular date .
usually you &apos;re kind of wrong , and some are not .
but in this case , we have to give full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that sparks the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
the idea became really tangible for them , you know that there are people living with mosquitoes .
for energy , this came to mind .
i decided that the unleashing of fireflies would be my contribution to the environment this year .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
i was told they &apos;re not going to bite . they &apos;re not going to even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of gadgets like this , but they don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability , and although there are many ways in which people are looking for it , i really only see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left out time , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
this one may contribute a modern contribution , and if you pay better than i expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up on them because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems to be easy , but it &apos;s not easy . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of the chimney , catch , flow under pressure , and then store somewhere , hoping it stays there .
there are some pilot projects that can do this at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but getting it to 100 percent is going to be very difficult . and getting an agreement for storing co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the longer-time question .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee what literally billions of times larger than any kind of garbage you can imagine of nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough nuss .
next , nuclear power .
they also have three big problems . the cost , especially in high-regulated countries . the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite human cooperation , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
i summarized the last three of the five .
it &apos;s renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is the energy density that these technologies create dramatically lower than the power plant .
these are energy vessels , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , thousands of times more land than a normal power station .
also , these sources underlie interruptions .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and the same is not constantly blowing the wind .
that &apos;s why , if you depend on these sources , you have a way to get the energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there are big prices here . there are challenges in transmission , for example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also need to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the charge problem .
and to show the dimension , i looked at all the kinds of batteries that are produced , looking at : the cars , the computers , cell phones , pocket lips , everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to the size of batteries that we &apos;re going to produce less than 10 minutes .
so what we need here is a big breakthrough , something that is going to be 100 times better than the approaches that we have right now .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumer .
if you want to support yourself by 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery .
now , where should we go ? what &apos;s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get there ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
they &apos;ll say in many , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think there are many here at the ted group who are already involved there .
bill gross has several companies , among other things called esolar , who have great solar thermal technologies .
vindeath khosla investes in dozens of companies who do great things and have interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , tracks the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear field ; modular , liquid .
development stopped some time ago in this industry , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the terrapower-concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to reasonably simulate whether it worked , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right materializing approach , it looks like this .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost profile is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as propulsions .
instead of breaking your head on it , you just burn it . great thing .
the uranium is used gradually , a bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as the passing wave of reactor .
it really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that &apos;s 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being burned today , so it &apos;s called a utility uranium .
the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you take oceanic water and you just filter it , you get enough fuel for the rest of the lifetime of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the intermediate step .
many talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and there &apos;s still some agriculture , and hopefully whale threat and cement will be clean up until then .
so in order to reach these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , have to completely reframe their electricity generation .
the other note is whether we &apos;re using zero emissions of technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this becomes a key element of this testimony .
if we go back from there , what should that look like in 2020 ?
it should again contain the two elements .
we should use the efficiency measures to get reduction . the less we emitate , the less the carbon sum will be , and therefore the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we do not lead to all the big reductions , just the same , or even less important to the others , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs we have to pursue full gas , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , in piloting projects and regulation changes .
there are many great books on this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david mckays &quot; pool energy for the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework where this can be discussed in , because we need support from all sides .
there are some things that need to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very concrete desire for us to invent this technology .
if you only give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is half-energy episode without co2 , i will take that wish .
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the buried between the long-term and the short-term people will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of those 2 billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what measures do i appeal to ?
we need to apply ourselves to more research money .
when countries meet like copenhagen in places , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss this innovation strategy , and they would be smiled by the smiling ones spent on these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a price signal .
we have to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue rational and complete and also the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists to do what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million . and even if we test our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
the hard step is building the first reactor to find another billion , the regularians and the place that actually makes the first one .
once the first one is done , when it &apos;s going to be as promised , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy density , is as different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to get that right , that means building deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium , and then the process starts to build up , and continues to work down ?
bg : yeah . today you have to replenish the reactor all the time , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and bring stuff in or out . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they &apos;re buried without all the complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution to waste itself .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these refrigerators or dry tanks in the reactors . that &apos;s our start fuel .
so what a problem with these reactors is what we fill in our filling and is dramatically reduced the volume of waste during this process .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where &apos;s the most interesting thing to do ?
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set up a place , and there are a lot of interesting rules of openness for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear . &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company in russia , india , i &apos;ve been here and i &apos;ve met the energy agenda and i &apos;ve talked about how energy agenda has been .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built it , so anybody who has done a fast reactor is a candidate for our first .
in your imagination , time frame and probability to really bring this into life ?
bg : now we need one of these scalable , executive things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is like the deadline that has given us the environmental models that we have to stop .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything is fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy to hold .
and luckily , today there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds that , in the same way , when their approaches work , can offer to their pilots .
and it would be best if you did it multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
given the great possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing you know ?
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been without environmental requirement , but it would have been so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s a modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s why if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and costs , the potential , almost the other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to introduce emergency services to try to maintain the temperature stable ?
bg : when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve eaten too much , and just before you get a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research direction called geoengineering that addresses various techniques to delay warming so that we can get 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
this is just an insurance method .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work at all on insurance , because it might make you lazy , so you keep eating because you know you &apos;re going to save your heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re leading to this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that if things are coming faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
climate maskepticists : do you have one or two sentences for those to maybe convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are living in very different camps .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is a bit like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems of investing in something that you only have later on -- and the investment is not so clear . in fact , ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there &apos;s no people in the world , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s not a big thing .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time remove the co2 , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t emitate co2 , i almost wish it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it as the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the bjlocal lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer , reducing poverty , fighting malaria and so on , there &apos;s a better waste of resources .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
there are other things that shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you come to large sums , and here , sensible people can disagree if you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to fund that . for me , most of the waste is happening here .
except , you &apos;re very short before a breakthrough , and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the strike you get is a very high energy episode , then the rich ones can only keep up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
his new magic is now , &quot; why is research not going to talk about anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still associated with the skepticist camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s now making the research argument .
and this is a mindset that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s being supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all the people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman introduced a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four-foot teams have to build the largest possible structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1-foot tape , about three meters of thread and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it pushes people very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide with students and developers and architects , even ctos of fortune 50-company , and there &apos;s something about this task that enables deep interfaces to work with them , and i want to share with you some of them .
usually most people start orienting themselves on the task .
they talk about what it will look like , they run around power .
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and you sketch and you lay out spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time building this growing structure all the time .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it gently at the top , step back and &quot; ta-da &quot; ! admire your work .
but what happens , almost all the time , is that the ta-da becomes an uh-oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and fall asleep .
there are a number of people who have much more uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst of them are fresh bwl graduates .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they make really poor shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have much more ta-da shapes , and under the best of which there are fresh students in kindergarten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , not only do they produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , why is this ? why ? what about them ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend time being the head of the spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t spend time in power fights .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok .
and then realize him .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children &apos;s gardening kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have multiple times the ability to repair colored prototypes .
construction players recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process .
and with each trial , children get instant feedback , which works and which doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance of working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of them is about 50 inches , bwl students get half of them , lawyers get a little bit more , but not much , kindergarten children are better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
one foot is the highest i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and make sure self-amplifying geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are a little bit about average . but here it gets interesting .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they &apos;re significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that happening ?
because they have special skills of processing .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team that regulates and attention to work will significantly improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that go typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
now i tried something interesting .
i thought , well let &apos;s take the poker service in a second .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize for software for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two-inch construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competitions have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so from the same bad team , one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are profound lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually invest time to create a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is to help me create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and visual tricks .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or attitudes , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow building .
there &apos;s a step-by-step guidance there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world how people optimize and refine the system .
there are also world records .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a commitment sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimally , like our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies ahead .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes to take us from an uh-oh -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve often asked my friends this question , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america is looking for superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;ve somehow moved to nostalgia , to winning thinking .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurer .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time ever available on this planet no matter what scale you want : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease .
there has never been a time like this before .
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70th .
my parents are the 80 on the far side .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they reformed the earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
we forced them . puff .
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us have barely threatened one generation before .
diphy , roteln , child paralysis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success of the scientific method .
and in my view , the scientific way to try things is to see if it works , change it if it doesn &apos;t , one of humanity &apos;s greatest achievements .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
and one of them is that , despite all our achievements , a billion people in the world go to bed every day .
that number goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to really devastate this world .
drinking water , ancient land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos innovate , we &apos;re also disappearing .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world that doesn &apos;t break it at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wound thinking .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we never needed scientific progress as urgent as we are now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to use it reasonably , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the threshold to an amazing , amazing event in many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time in which we &apos;ve struggled progress , in which we &apos;ve fueled more than we &apos;ve launched .
people are hoping in their faith , and it &apos;s so close that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will set it free .
and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right to their opinion , even a right to progress .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
they &apos;re not right to their own facts . &apos; sorry , they &apos;re not .
and it took me a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccinations for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to find resistance in resistance towards what is ultimately the most effective thing in public health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and continued to do .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetic food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a certain way instead of shooting around an encrophal in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we rich , we walk in , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about these articles , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me crazy were not a fanatic at all .
these were people who were careful , educated people , durable people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we talk about it in twin .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little leadership about &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for this , and i think we know what reasons these are .
we have lost trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call it a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , viox , weapons of mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election in 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
take nothing for granted .
but here it is : if you have to prove that you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that , for the reason , we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that connected autism epidemic to masses , mumps , and roteln vaccine .
very scary .
studies were done to see if that was true .
studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe in what we see , what we believe , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government worker that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world to sink the immunization for masses .
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened was we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody have masses here ?
has a single person in the audience ever seen somebody die of masses ?
don &apos;t happen very often .
don &apos;t happen at all in this country , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from masses , 20 an hour .
but because this didn &apos;t happen here , we can displace it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of humanity &apos;s worst minds .
no fear , no torture , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
he &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , except for paul to walk around and talk about vaccines and say how valuable they are , and that people should just stop biting .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul speaks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say he can &apos;t say he &apos;s a gun laundry .
he gets calls home because people like to tell him where his kids are going to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
go on , go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we have masses in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a military of mine wrote to me a couple of weeks ago , and she said , &quot; i think i &apos;m a little bit too shrill . &quot;
no one ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against child paralysis . absolutely not .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis yesterday in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in lagos got on an airplane this morning and just flew to los angeles right now , he &apos;s over ohio .
and in a few hours he lands and rents a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to hip in lies . we love that .
have you all taken your vitamins this morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidancy that helps you leapfrog .
i know they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly demonstrating it .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i totally agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishing cold and ridiculous to ourselves that can afford it .
so we &apos;re going off , and where are we going ?
we go to the poor of the placebo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of them -- gingko , fraud , echinacea , fraud , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it ; it &apos;s fraud .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what care ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt my experts on mammography , &quot; or any cancerous jellyfish trying to treat his patients with caffiti .
when they get to that path where belief and magic replace them , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beef , bone and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in one country that &apos;s worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have it . they always have it .
now , the most brain loose epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this absurd struggle between the forbid genetic foods and the bio-elite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every rice , every branch of petersilence , every rosencole , has been changed by the people .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
there were no cantaloupei melons .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 1,000 years .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can take it closer . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a rice , and the stuff can help millions of people increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re rejecting genetic food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid we &apos;re really dead , and it holds millions of people from bloom .
you know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we currently have . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and why ? genetic food changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotten stuff like maniok .
maniok is something that is eating half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this into it right now .
and then people could eat it and not get blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about pushing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insights on larger food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to be as guilty as we have before , i think we want to be innocent , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , they may want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i certainly want that .
it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to go , and we &apos;ll move them where we want to .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but as we go up into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to do that .
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem odd that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it the way i think of it as , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to happen if only somebody believes it . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s only because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient believes the effect , is a measurable effect .
a deception becomes something real because someone perceives it this way .
so in order to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least been in every magician since the 1950s .
i learned him from cub scout of magic the pathfinder in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hand like this .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , i &apos;m just going to put together my wrist right there .
that &apos;s how you can see that at no point any time anything moves , as long as i press here , nothing can go to my sleeve or emerge .
and the goal here is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is going well , the knife is held by my mere physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so strong in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
nothing goes to my sleeve or comes out , no trickiness , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach little kids to be interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in this room probably know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i include my wrist to make sure nothing disappears or comes out in my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i hold my wrist is because it &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
because the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from the back , these fingers here , my finger , just from where it was , to a position where it was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no childhood .
so it &apos;s here . right .
and as i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you can &apos;t see that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way that he processes information , doesn &apos;t count it , one , two , three , but seeing it as a group .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my finger , which is there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s hidden by this movement that the fingers are moving back .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really blew me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so this was an amazing thing for me .
because what it turns out is that if you offer placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspirintablet , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you pass the shape in which you give placebo the placebo , for example , changes into a smaller pill , and colored these blue and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective .
and that , although none of them are any pharmaceutical -- they &apos;re just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really freaked me out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all yet .
if you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than any pills .
one colored capsule , which is in one end yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the dosage also plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that doses also matter .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with an ineffective -- a few millions of an effective substance you inject to a patient .
this creates a very strong image in your mind . this is much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time we have a projector .
so in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property , and it &apos;s just our belief in it that makes us more powerful .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something which is obviously deception , and let it look real .
we know from that study that you have to reach the needle if you want to go to the point .
this is an eight-inch long hutneedle . it &apos;s very , very peaks , and i &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damians &apos; especially cultured meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this needle into my skin and drive it through the other side , until it restrikes .
if you get lushed -- if you fall easy in the chicken -- i introduced this to a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly grew widespread .
so i &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re going to quickly get evil , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to do the first healing part here in the back .
you can see it in a second , but you can see it away if you want .
so , it goes like this , right here where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little entry .
i &apos;m really sorry . is this crazy ?
and just now , a little bit through my skin and on the other side , like that .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had when we had a knife trick .
something like this .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid , and it &apos;s self-penetrating , just to give us a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay , i didn &apos;t really see it . &quot;
people in the side rooms come in now .
let me show it from near .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can turn it around .
sorry . if you get evil , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people in the back or the people who see this later on on , will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , he would -- look here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really was , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me squeeze some blood out for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take out the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
but i think , in this framework here and intention of making something real out of deception , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;ll see ourselves in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness these days .
i &apos;ve had some people count the number of books that have been published with happiness in the title in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 , and there &apos;s been much more .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in researchers under happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this flood of work , there are multiple cognitive trains that sort of make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive traps .
this is true of layered thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess as everyone else .
the first of these traps is a resistance to admit complexity .
it turns out the word of happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could narrow it down , but in general , that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to adopt the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a change in experience and memory : it &apos;s basically between happy being in his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both threw together in the notion of happiness .
and the third one is concentration illusion , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without distorting its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures , who reported a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the shooting sound .
and then he added up , really quite emotionally , that &apos;s ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t have that .
what it had ruined was the memories of experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was in love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and memory was all he had to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present day and knows the present is able to reexperience the past , but basically only has the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor prizes -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now if i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is that counting and sustaining the history of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor speaks to by saying , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and memory self , and confusing those two is part of the transforming concept of happiness .
now , the memorizing self is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
not only do we tell stories when we make ourselves tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we must keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients getting in a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into the details . she &apos;s no longer painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to cover their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered from both of them ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his reflection was longer , and every minute of pain the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the gut reflection than patient b.
the stories of the mirror were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very construction or great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse was where the pain was at the very end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people about their reflection , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in remembering .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memorizing self .
clearly , from the perspective of the living self , b had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually increase the reflection of the patient a by simply pushing the tube in without getting too much of it .
that &apos;s going to make the patient suffer , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have caused the living self to be worse off by patient a , and you &apos;ve done that remembering yourself is much better off the patient a , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story of your experience .
what is a story about ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories we have to memory , and it &apos;s true of the stories we invent .
what a story represents is outbreaks , major moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end dominated .
well , living self lives continuously .
it has moments of life , one by one .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i calculated this -- you know , the psychological presence is true for about three seconds . which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in one month . there &apos;s about 600,000 of them don &apos;t leave behind .
most of you are completely ignored by remembering self .
and yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count that what happened in those moments of life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in the world .
and how we used it to seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that reminds the memory itself .
so we have the memorizing self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal with time .
from the perspective of the living self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first week , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .
this doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
for the memory of itself , a two-week vacation is hardly better than the one week vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a memory of a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , remembering itself is doing more than remembering and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , had two reflections of two different surgeons and decides which to choose , then the one who chooses the memory that &apos;s less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon .
the living self has no voice in that choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as predicted memories .
and basically , you can think of this , you know , as a tyranny of the memory self , and you can think of the memory itself as one that kind of drains the living self through experiences that the living self does not need .
i have the impression that if we do vacation , it &apos;s very often the case , which means we make vacation largely in the service of memory itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we consume from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations given to the dominance of the memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often about how often i think about other vacations .
and i &apos;ve probably consumed by my memories of this three-week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures inside , i would have spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s about three and a half hours .
there seems to be an disagreement there .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , in how little appetite i have on the toes of memories , but even if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight over the course of the weight that we give experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the vacation , all your images are being destroyed , and you get an amnesian drug so you will remember nothing .
now would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were to choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you might get an answer . and if you think about a different answer .
why we select the vacation that we &apos;re looking for is a problem we have with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness up .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you &apos;d ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the earth itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to have a pretty good idea of the happiness of the earth itself over time .
if you ask about the happiness of the memory , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms is going to screw up the research of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the researchers on well-being that has raped happiness in that same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the living self and the satisfaction of the memory itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate ones .
the gallup organization has a global survey where over half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson we learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with your life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody and you were to tell them , oh , your father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has ordered their lives as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what determines happiness itself .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly about being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , you will end up doing very different things .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a replacement of well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we don &apos;t notice the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , do you think the people in california have to be happier if they live , say , in ohio ?
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the memorable self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up pulling to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people moving to california in hope of getting happier .
well , your living self will not get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we spoke to me a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup poll .
is this something you can participate in , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left now ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll is a number that we absolutely did not expect .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self .
when we looked at how feelings vary income .
and it turns out that among a 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a huge representative sample among a 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly less unhappy , the poorer they get .
we get an absolutely flat line on that .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously money doesn &apos;t raise an experience happiness , but that lack of money is certainly miserable , and we can measure it very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , of memory itself , you get a different story .
the more money you make , the happier you are .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took this fund seriously , i mean , it all seems to be put on their head , everything we think , in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there any chance that politicians would generally take a fund like this seriously and make politics based on this ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
recognition is going to be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
people are recognizing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life grades , so we have to have this discussion pretty quickly .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the memory itself or whether you think of the living self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the years ahead .
in the united states , you &apos;re struggling to measure the experience happiness of the population .
that will , i think , be part of the national statistics in the next decade or two .
well , it seems to me that this is going to be , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pursue over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design computer games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is in online games .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people including all of you to spend more time playing more and more fun games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe too much time if you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , following my research at the institute of the future is just the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to dramatically increase that time .
i calculated that the time it took is at 21 billion hours of play a week .
this may seem a little bit reluctant first , so i can do it again : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture pretty much describes why i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographer phil toledano .
he wanted to catch the feelings in play , so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might miss some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also external concentration , deep into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;re going to see some nuances here that are upward eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player standing on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
one epic victory is a result that &apos;s so superior in a positive way that you didn &apos;t know it was possible before .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you do it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do that . that &apos;s an epic victory .
this is a player just before an epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solvers all over the world when we look at the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who are on the edge of an epic settlement .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it &quot; i &apos;m bad &quot; face in life , and it &apos;s actually my face , you know ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me making the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why do we do better than in real life ?
that &apos;s a problem a lot of players have .
we think in reality , we &apos;re not as good as we play in .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
we achieve more in game worlds . i mean good at working with motivation to do something meaningful , inspired for collaboration .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turn to our best version , at any given time and immediately are willing to try to solve the problem as long as necessary as we need to try it again after the failure .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or cynical .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t do everything ?
how can we transfer these feelings from games to reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem solving .
and i &apos;ve found some things that make the epic victories possible in online worlds .
so , first of all , when you get into one of these online games , especially world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a world-treating mission , and that is instantly available .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect at its current level in the game , right ?
so they do .
they never get a problem they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , so they have to struggle , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are wise employees .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with you to finish your epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in real life , that feeling that there are a finger sweeping staff ready .
and there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and plus-one strength , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have plus-one talk and + 1 crazy idea , plus-20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get the feedback in real life .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of an epic settlement all the time in these worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
to this day , all the world of warcrafi players spent 5.93 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first primate ancestors began to upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend playing right now , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but it also suits . because it turns out that using this whole time to play , we actually change what we can do as humans .
we develop into collaborative thinking , heart creature .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe in .
if you look at this interesting statistic recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person in a country today spends 10,000 hours with strong play culture with online games to the 21st of life .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10,080 hours is the exact overall work they spend in school from grade five to graduate high school -- if you never fail .
so here we have a full parallel education path where young people learn as well , which means to be a good player , like anything else they learn at school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overfly . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying mosquitos on any subject subject to the 21st year of life , we become masters in it .
we become as good at doing whatever the most important people in the world do .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master-players .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players terribly good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have almost never been there to provide any human potential before .
so many people we currently have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are remarkably good at something .
and the next decade we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry is developing consoles that save energy and work on mobile wires instead of the broadband internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , can play online .
you &apos;d expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
we have 1.5 billion players overall .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to master these games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , urgency optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivation works .
urgency optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to master a hurdle , along with the belief that we have an greened hope for success .
players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like to play with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason for this is because it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody spends time with us that the rules will be held , that we have the same goal , and until the game end remain there .
so , playing together allows for connectivity to grow , trust and trust .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warfi players plays 22 hours a week , sort of as a part-time job .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that we work optimal as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
and finally , epical meaning .
players love to be part of awe missions of planetary masses .
here &apos;s a backbone formation to bring that to the right light , and you all know wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they put together more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in every other wiki in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one conclusion . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that as individuals , they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change virtual worlds , but not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a local scientist .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness any less than a mass migration in virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelmed .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life .
you can make more powerful social ties in games than in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely logical at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cubes made out of sheep . you know ?
before these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep &apos;s skating .
and these were sort of the first of people to have developed toys .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story , the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games were actually invented cube games , in the kingdom of lydia during famine .
there was such a famine that the king of lydia decided to make a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube and the united , a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so deep into the cube , because games are so fascinating and surrounded with satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived that famine for 18 years by eating and playing the next day .
likewise , i think , we &apos;re setting up games today .
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get away from everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , famine didn &apos;t get better , so the king decided to set up a final cube game .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they played a cube game , and the seventh got to break up an epic adventure .
they were leaving poetry and they were looking for a new home , and they were leaving as many people as there was food to survive , looking for the rest for an area where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but newest dna evidence shows that the etrussians who later formed the roman empire show the same dna as the old poetry .
so scientists recently came to think that herodotus &apos;s crazy story actually is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years to explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe they actually saved their people through play by flipping into games for 18 years and then having this inenvironment and learning so much about playing with each other that they were saving the entire civilization .
so , we can do that too .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the world &apos;s first strategy game in real time of warcrafi series . this was 16 years ago .
they played cube games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion hours a week .
we should infer that half of us spend an hour playing with games a day until we solved the real world &apos;s problems .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems from the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been doing in the last few years at the institute of the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , expressing how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people are empowering to implement that idea into reality .
we imagine epic victories and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;ll show you just briefly three games that i designed to try and create people epic victories in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage .
the oil shortage is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough online content to make it realistic for them , and they &apos;re actually living their lives without oil , so if they &apos;re on the line , they tell us where they live , and then they &apos;re getting video of how much information , how they &apos;re going to affect food , how much in real time .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompaniing it since the last three years .
and i can tell you it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re walking towards .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have kept the habits that are in the game .
so for the next world record , we set up a bigger , higher goal than just oil spill .
we developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute of the future .
the starting point is to compute a supercomputer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global mortality system , &quot; of course .
the call to gamers to sign up , we created almost like a jerry gross movie .
you know jerry bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team . they have the astronauts , the scientist , the ex-beach fling , and they can only save the world together .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say everybody is in the dream team , and it &apos;s our job of creating the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
and the last game we bring out on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you close the game , you get the award from the world bank , &quot; social change , &quot; by 2010 .
we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn social redesign .
we have a comic about this . we have levels high for regional understanding , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in development areas that benefit from having their own social enterprises together to save the world .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to reach close social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we play together significant games to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me like this .
when i look forward in the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can create any imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the world-changing games start !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that came up with me a couple of months ago writing an italian wired article .
i &apos;ve always been gripping my synonym dictionary , but i &apos;ve done the work of writing , and it occurred to me that i &apos;ve never proposed in my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the entry .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective : &quot; crawling , helpless , disrupted , dead , mutilted , wounded , wounded , discarded , lazy , disconnected , balanced , impotent , impotent , paralyzed , displaced , nailed , nasty , naked .
antonyme : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend out loud , and i had to laugh for the first time , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; court , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t keep talking , and i had to stop reading and collect myself from this transcendent wordscape and shocked emotional .
of course , this was a perfect synonym dictionary , and i just thought the output must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s when i was just starting elementary school and began to build and form my self-image outside my family around me , in terms of other kids and the rest of me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use synonym dictionary at the time .
if i took that post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me could perceive as a person whose life can &apos;t be positive , but today i &apos;m celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called myself up the online copy of 2009 , expecting me to find a proper contribution here .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and in particular , the last two words under near antony are all about healthy .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in this words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the language of an escape has a huge force because what you &apos;re talking about is also manifest .
so , what do we actually want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
a human being , remarkably , could reach out to be mindless as a child , restrict them and overcome them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors to you ?
a person who opened doors for me was my pediatrician at a.i. dupont institute in wilmington in dolphins .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . an italo american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he was always called dr. p.
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just like creating for work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physiotherapy .
i had to often repeat individual practice with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated these benches more than anything . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine i even negotiated as a five-year-old child with dr. p. so i tried to stop these practice , naturally without success .
and one day he watched me in one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tiring and guilty -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear those bars one day .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p. so i did the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that many five-year-old girls in the clinic in the second floor , but actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me shaped my self as a strong and powerful young girl , and so i could imagine seeing myself as one of nature of strong and powerful and atlethal .
this is just one example of many ways adults can stimulate the imagination of a child .
but as the already civilized examples from synonym dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we would all wish : to allow anyone to see themselves as a powerful person .
our language increases the social change that has been triggered in many cases by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints of titan and artificial hip joints for age-old bodies that allow people to actually use their own possibilities and to move beyond the borders that their natural fate in the world .
so maybe this technological change indicates that ever since there was a different truth , that every human being can give something special and very powerful and that human ability to adapt is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people ask me over and over again to tell me how i deal with widrities , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never matched for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about answering the questions of people and why i understand why .
this phrase of dealing with widerness lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on mastering a challenge without being shaped by a connected experience , as if my life had been so successful , because i could take the prosthetic face of a prosthetic life as well as a human being .
but the truth is that we change . of course we are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
widerness is not an obstacle that we need to curve to better deal with our lives .
wields are simply among our lives .
and i tend to think of wielties as my shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s with me all the time .
and i don &apos;t want to have any impact whatsoever , to break down the heavy of a human fight .
there are wives and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just too real , and each person is about it differently , but the question is not whether we deal with vitality or not , but how we deal with it .
so not only are we responsible for preserving the people we love from fatalities , but also preparing them to deal with it well .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have two things to be clear : for one thing , for medical fact , amputated and for the other , the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability i had to deal with is that the world is constantly meant , it could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who care about us , and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even to provide a forecast about quality of life that they expect , we have to watch out that we don &apos;t actually have someone disabled .
maybe the current concept that &apos;s just paying attention to what &apos;s in a broken , and how we fix that , for each one , is a greater disability than the pathology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holistically , and not take all its forces and possibilities and recognize , we will create , in addition to the natural struggle you may have to lead , another disease .
we degrade a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond patology and focus on all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , there is a connection between the perception of our inadequacy and our great inventor mind .
we shouldn &apos;t deny or deny these challenging times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor should we turn them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing odds .
i &apos;m perhaps more likely to think that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome wieldities , but that we &apos;re open to embrace them , packing them on the sharp , also use a fight expression and maybe even dancing with them .
and maybe we can &apos;t see wields as anything that is natural and assertive and useful and feel so harassed by their presence .
that year we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , pointed to something very true in the human character .
i would rewrite it this way : not the most powerful of its kind , and not the intelligent one of its species , but the one that can best adapt change .
conflict emerges creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and flourish is determined by the struggle of the human mind to transform through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest human abilities .
and we may only know which wood we &apos;re cut from when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s the sense of wielness , a sense of perceptions , is a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give resilience a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
maybe we can see wields as a change .
joyness is a change we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one , but not the normal one , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person if they really were ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great if we could unlock this paradigm of normality to another possibility or strength , to even make it a little bit more dangerous , we can unleash the forces of very many children and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
anthropocene has found that we &apos;ve always asked people from the members of our society to be useful and to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , have contributed older people and people with severe physical injuries , and this may have happened because life experience was valuable in the survival button of these people for society .
they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city i grew up in a food market in that red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a scheffel tomato .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear a guy behind me say , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that one .
and of course , it did click .
this was dr. kean , a man i only knew from narratives of my mother about that day , because , of course , i was typical about two weeks to my birthday .
my mother &apos;s office was on vacation , so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no legs , and my feet turned to them , and i only had a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other foot , he was the bridge , this stranger had to deliver bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk and would never be as mobile as other kids or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they &apos;ve just punished me . &quot;
what was really extraordinary to me was he was collecting newspapers from my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won at a spelling competition in grade two , whether i &apos;d gone with the pathways at parade for halloween , whether i &apos;d won my scholarship or a medical student of mine .
and he called this part of his classes the x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t just emphasize how important this factor can be for the quality of a human life .
and dr. kean continued to say , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t constantly get said something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you leave kids alone , then children can do a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and like someone , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me when i was 15 years old , if i had swapped my prostheses against meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have hesitated a second .
i really wanted to be normal back then .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this has happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , rather than despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who have opened doors to me , rather than encounter people who wanted to constrain me or overcome me an idea .
you see , it really takes only one person to demonstrate to you how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate their own inner powers -- the human mind is so recommended -- if you can do that , and open a door for somebody at a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open doors themselves .
the real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe .
it means getting something out of one is tickling out the potential .
again , what potential do we want to disrupt ?
in the &apos; 60s , a case study was done in britain , and then gymnasia were transformed in total schools .
they call this streaming trials in the united states , we call this &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are shared with notes .
and the a student gets tested tirelessly , gets better teachers and so on .
they then , over a three-month period of time , students with a &quot; abundant &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; they told them they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote in .
and of course , it breaks your heart up to you to hear that vice versa students were told that they were only sufficient .
and it was the same after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except for the students who had failed school .
and the key thing about this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t inferred .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the one-person students , and they &apos;re enough students with the grade , and they taught them something and they treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that has no more hope . he finds nothing more beautiful . he lacks our natural childhood curiosity , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human mind , we continue to hope to find ourselves and other people around themselves , to be curious and phantom , we really put our forces in a positive way .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new modes of being .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; every child knows god , not the name of god , not always .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , by few changes in your genes , you could have a better memory -- more precise , more precise and more quickly .
or want to be fitter , stronger , more force .
would you like to become more attractive and confident ?
how about living longer in good health ?
or maybe they are one of those who have always longed for more creativity .
which would you like the most ?
which would you like to have if it could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a couple . probably about as many creative people there are here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is all this just education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been an ongoing theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s subject .
the great genetics in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in lit of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the proof biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch off your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can still take a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s talk , because it &apos;s not going to be about it .
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it good for others or for us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve laid a bush as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the margins of life , all the species that existed on the tips of these branches have had success : they survived ; it has demonstrated its environment and strength .
the human part of that bush , way to the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzee about six or eight million years ago .
in that period of time , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re fairly remote from the other parts of life , but in fact most part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
do you realize that we can use this and actually enable the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetic ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically undistinguishable from what comes out of pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , do you realize that every one of us in our gut has more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times the number .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asks her self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospitality environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all the nutrients that they only wish for without effort on their part .
it &apos;s really a lightweight way for bacteria , with occasional interruptions of unintended , jeodch forced to escape .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria just as important to their lives .
they help digestive food , and they protect it against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
are we in some sort of evolutionary balance in a species ?
or are we wired to be something else -- something that might be even better adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe the last 800 years or then human species -- in the last billion years .
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is only short for a second ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and human life , a small notation .
that &apos;s us .
this is also the submission of this speech , so i hope d hatred you liked .
now , when i was a ninuling in college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental in most of the lives of solid organisms , each cell divides , and all the genetic information of the cell continues in both daughter cells .
but at the time , as multi-celled organisms began to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome continues , the rest of the body becomes devastating .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our body in evolution at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it came to my growing doubt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who introduced his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a knock on his hotel room door .
he opens the door .
there &apos;s a beautiful spare about him in clothing showgirl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that as a doctor , i worked on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to restore health after disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the passing of the genome to the next generation , adapting and survival after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they and i have evolved like boster rocket to send genetic questioning to the next level of orbit to fall into the sea .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood that woody allen understood when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean preferring the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest , the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution privileges the creatures that fit best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
because of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermophil , and therefore the hot steam survival otherwise , if fish were there , it would be vacuum cooked fish , and yet they managed to make it a habitable environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and particularly how we look forward in the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason that we were able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise chosen and would have been removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species have configuring out our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , that they adapt to us just as we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander and circulate and mix so much that they can &apos;t say isolation is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed on nature &apos;s forces .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution are slowly grinding , but they &apos;re inexhaustible .
and as far as isolation as we colonize away as a species , there will be isolation and changes in the environment that evolution could naturally produce .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a lovely , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that &apos;s not easy , but led and decided , as an individual , to the choices we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be that we do that ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people now , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to assume genetic adaptations that would heal and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce risk of cancer or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
as we look ahead , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in it to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at about 20,000 dollars and the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t take long to be reality that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
one week ago , the national academy of engineering loaded the draper prize for francis arnold and wild stemmer , two scientists who developed independently the natural process of evolution to go faster and lead wishing proteins in a more efficient way -- that francise .
a few years ago , the laser prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took a adult skin cell , a fibroblaste , and through manipulation of only four genes induced the cell to lead it to a pluripotentially born cell .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that human insulin can make in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t only protect themselves , but can also serve immunity to other viruses .
believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study going on with vaccine for influenza that &apos;s been built into the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future it will be much more possible .
imagine just two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and egg cells or newly fertilized egg to give your children a better chance to live a healthier life -- elimination of diabetes , remove the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also give us goodbye to super-attributes , hyper-capacity -- better memory .
why not have the phrase of one ken jennings , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the watson machine ?
why not have the fast muscles that will allow them to walk faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be irresistible .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed from alt-style to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process which generally requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it for a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
these are decisions that your grandchildren , or your grandchildren have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , which is more successful , which is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society of dielary and uniformity , or robuster and diversity ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop wisdom and master the wisdom we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions wise ?
in good like evil and early than you might think , these decisions will be about us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something now , a portable robot that gives you human ability , or another that helps wheelchair drivers stand up and go back .
we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
they &apos;re not anything but something that you put in the morning that will give you extra strength and will increase your speed further and will help them keep your balance , for example .
this is actually the true confusion of human and machine .
but not only that -- they merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about american soldiers on average , wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injury , 30 percent of them -- chronic injury .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to hulc now -- or the universal load carrier .
soldier : with the hulc exoskeleton , i can carry 200 pounds on different terrain for many hours .
its flexible design allows you to hook deep , crawl and execute highly agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and longevity .
we &apos;re here with our industrial partners in this device to imagine this new exoskeleton this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at the wheelchair drivers , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people globally estimated sitting in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries in their lifetime -- 20s , 30s , 40s -- being hit by fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number multiplies .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain impact , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , for 500 years , since his , i &apos;ve been saying , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now , let me introduce you to elegs , which is carried by amanda boxtel , who suffered a spinal cord injury 19 years ago , which has concluded that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is our elephant .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches , send back signals to our onboard-computer , which is attached here on her back .
here are batterings packaging , the engine engine engine is on your hips , as well as your knees that you move forward in this fairly smoothly and very natural gangart .
i was 24 years old and best , when a monstrous pure tree was paralyzed by a ski ride .
in the fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my basin .
not long after that , a doctor step into my clinic , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;re never going to be able to go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every fifth hope from my consciousness .
adaptable technologies have since made it possible for me to learn how to ski again and climb and even ride with my hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelchair drivers , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fireman &apos;s main man in a volunteer solving the train .
well , in our city , volunteers supported a highly skilled professional firemen , you have to be at the brand quite early to be able to mix with you .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the brand site , so i had pretty good opportunities to be able to go in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the responsible headman and figure out what our job would be .
when i found the main man , he had a very serious conversation with the home owner who had certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the pajamas and barefoot under a screen in the rain flowing while her house was in flames .
the other volunteer who had just arrived before me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- reached the main man first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the house owner .
the dog ! i was static .
there was some lawyer or wealth administrators who could now tell the rest of his life that he went to a burning house to save a living creature just because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next one .
the main man wave me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you &apos;ve got to go into the house .
you have to go up , pass by the fire , and this woman has to get some shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped to do , but i went up -- the stairs up , down the halls , past the true firemen who had already been quite ready to go to the bedroom to get some shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i carried my prey back down , where i met my enemy at the front door and the beloved dog .
we wore our estimates outside to the home owner , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the firemen received a letter from the home owner in which they thanked themselves for the brave deployment of their house .
one about all valued kindness : somebody actually had brought her some shoes .
both in my profession with robin hood and my career as a volunteer fireman , i am witnessing generosity and kindness at large , but i also see acts of kindness and the mud of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i look around this room and see people who have either achieved an accomplished success , or are on their way there , i want to offer a reminder : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in someone else &apos;s life until they reached their first million .
if you have to give something , now you give it .
serve in a soup kitchen , clean up a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save a person &apos;s life , but every day allows us to change one .
so go ahead , save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret to humanity &apos;s progression .
a place where women take the recipes with sex saying hello , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not like you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the wild bonobos world in the forest of congo .
bonobos are our next living relatives along with chimpanzees .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressiveness .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overstated this issue in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of medal .
whereas chimpanzees are led by great , scary candles , bonoboo society is led by empowered females .
they really came up with something , because that leads to a profoundly tolerant society where deadly violence has not been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under primates .
they live in the deep congolese urbanium forest , and it &apos;s hard to see .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the foam of a violent argument that has been raging for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also threatens the survival of bonobos .
meat trade and the decrease of the tree is that you couldn &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remained bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laughter that the trees are shaking .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have common , bisexual sex , interacting partners , and rules of conflict and social angels .
i &apos;m not saying this is the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of bonobos is made up of more than the cama sutra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love playing their lives long .
play is not just child games .
for us and it &apos;s game essential for connecting relationships and care for tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos play , you see the evolutionary origins of human lakes , dance and rituals .
play is the tickle that holds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images right from the wild .
first of all , a ball game in bonobo-style -- and i don &apos;t think of soccer .
so here &apos;s a young female and males in a tracking game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
that could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts it in the eggs . &quot;
only i think he likes it more , right ?
yeah !
so sex games are distributed , both in bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideal wealth of getting new elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how the game needs both trust and promotes -- while simultaneously making it incredibly fun .
but the game is a shape-shifter .
play is a shape-shifter , and it can take on a lot of forms that some of which are a little bit more quiet , imaginative , curious -- perhaps to rediscover the astonishing .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think just as they play us sometimes alone , and we &apos;re borrowing our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected linked that we create is really the nutrient ground of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future in which we need to adapt to more and more challenges , through greater creativity and prints , cooperation .
the secret is that the game is key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptation joker .
in order to successfully adapt to an inconsistent world , we have to play .
but are we going to make the best out of our toy drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people the same way , life is not made of teeth and claws alone .
even when it doesn &apos;t seem to be hardly appropriate , perhaps the most necessary game .
and so , my primate comrades , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together while we rediscover creativity to crony and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in the mid-1979 , exactly the same day , at the same moment , each one is having a baby -- okay .
so two couples , each one is a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the creation , because if you think about generating all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in one case , sperm carries a y chomosom hitting the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm carries an x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
they are viable , they &apos;re both inexpensive .
we &apos;ll go back to these guys later .
for most of my activities , i have two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m a historian , and in this case , i study how people were dealing with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they were dealing with body fluids , with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i did at my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have physical guys who are asking social norms .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamesian twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with dwarfs -- so people who were smaller than common .
and i worked very often with intersexual people whose gender is atypical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexuality .
intersexuality occurs in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of gender variants that don &apos;t conform to male or female standard .
in one case , you may have someone with an xy chromosomes , and the sry gene of y chomosoms leaves the protogonads we all have with fetal stadium to grow up to testicles .
and so the testosterone is giving off the testosterone in the fetal days .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to see the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called androgenic receptor defect .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develops more to the typical female course of this .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually until they reach puberty and their breasts grow and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody comes to the fact that there &apos;s something different here .
and they do some tests and they find that instead of eggs and uterus , they actually carry in and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person as actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies called adrenalines .
they &apos;re in the back of our bodies .
and by the way , the androgens that are virilizing hormones .
most women , like me , i think , are a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomes , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually respond to androgens .
we produce androgens , and we respond to androgens .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was exposed more androgens than a woman who was born with testicles and has an androgenic receptor defect .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual standing not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread across all the bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had raised a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found out he had egersticks and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate side cattle hyperbladder .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his side kidneys were so highly active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genitaly was male , his brain was exposed to the more typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one knew anything .
and it was only when he turned 19 that he got enough medical problems , actually because he was inside the menstruating doctors that he was female inside .
okay , just one quick example of one variant in intersexuality .
some people with xx chromosomes develop something called ovotestica , which is wrapped around ovarian tissue of dense tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different variants .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s dwarfs or siamesian twins , whether it &apos;s intersexual -- often adapted to the norm from surgeons is not because this would be advantageous to their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often do different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical leap comes in with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman means having a female identity ; being a black person is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually represents something very different for us , it confuses us in terms of those categories .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , which are two people in a body .
where i &apos;d seen most exciting recently was the south african runner caster semenya last year , whose gender was questioned at the leichatlethic world championship in berlin .
many journalists called me with the question , &quot; what test are you going to do to tell us whether caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journalists that there was no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t attract a line between male and female , or between male and intersexually and female and intersexually ; we tend to be the disconnect line as natural .
so we have this situation where , the further our science progresses , we have to stand around so much that these categories that we thought are more robust anatomic categories , which made very simple arrangements to create permanent identity skatories than we did .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology allowed .
in our view , we went to all sorts of inconvenient areas .
for example , we are staring at the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we differ from them just by a few nucleotides ?
as we continue to push our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of discomfort , where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories that we probably had are too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different forms of human life .
one of the areas in which we see this for the second , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about where a body becomes human , so that it has a different right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when is someone dead ?
our ancestors had never had that hard to deal with the question of when someone was dead .
they kept a bug under their nose , and when she moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if it didn &apos;t move , you &apos;d dig it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people &apos;s vital organs and we want to plant them to other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re caught in the fight with the really difficult question of when someone &apos;s dead , and that &apos;s what makes us a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now you might think that the whole collapse of categories would make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m progressive political , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , i &apos;m nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i &apos;m excited about .
and i &apos;m excited about this in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first know that i am a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were biased , i know they were more sexist , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and so radically , in what they were doing , every few years , looking at the narrow musical music in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened to the founding fathers in 1776 .
the founding fathers , in my view , were the original anatomical activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they proved back was an anatomical concept , and they replaced it through another that was radically and beautiful , and for 200 years was precise for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy , and monarchy was based on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the masters of the ancient world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth rights .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were hoping that people who had political power should have that political power because of the inherited blood line from the grandfather to the son and so on .
the founding fathers showed this idea back and replaced it through a new anatomical concept , and this concept said that all humans were created equally .
they nivellized the playground , and they decided that anatomically , the common ground , they didn &apos;t matter the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things grew together .
democracy grew in , but at the same time , the science grew in .
if you look at the story of founding fathers , it turns out that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world .
they went away from explanations of supernatural ways , and they showed things like a supernatural concept of power , back where transmission is based on a very vative concept of birth right .
they moved to a natural concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they created a concept that was about anatomical commonalities .
and so they &apos;ve really prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women who aspired the election right , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatomic commonality is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a utero and iron than difference , that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote .
and women argued this successfully .
the next thing was the successful civil rights movement where we saw people like sobottlenecks , who spach , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marshing rows of the citizenship movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color based on anatomical commonalities before anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same with the disabled legal movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we have to start asking why we maintain certain divisions .
well , i want to sustain certain divisions , anatomically seen , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should be right to give their insight to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical separations that make sense to me , and that we , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether it makes sense .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been witnessed at the beginning of the talk .
we witnessed two creatures in the middle of 1979 on exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , was born three months old , so she was born on june 1 , 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born for the birthday minister , so he &apos;s born on march one in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months old , she earns all sorts of rights three months before heinrich -- to have the right to choose sex to drink the right .
heinrich has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the timeline of his birth .
we find other oddities about what their rights are .
heinrich , because you assume he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s the one with xy -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now be brought in what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , in all states , cannot perceive the same right that heinrich in all states has the right to marry .
heinrich can maria , in every state , maria can maria only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomical categories that are problematic and questionable in many ways .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science makes such progress in the realm of anatomy that we have to get to a point where we have to say that a democracy that is based on anatomy might fall apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up on science , but at the same time it feels like science is doing itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is taking some kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to draw a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point decided that to marry a man doesn &apos;t have a chromosome , and to marry a woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the androgenic receptor defect .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t judge people by &quot; their skin color , but by the characteristic of their character , &quot; and then go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their traits ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we should distribute rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever that probably deserve socially than some people i know .
i want to say that i probably know some bright labradordogs that are more capable , more intelligent and richer decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40-year-olds i know .
so how do we operate the question for the characteristics of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and one part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality was something that would be machine in the future -- could be made visible through the fmri ?
do we really want to go this way ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it really seems to be important to think about the idea that the united states is leadership to worry about questions about democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing really well , and i think we &apos;d be doing our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation of what it &apos;s like in iran , for example , where a man who is drawn sexually to other men who is punished to die with is because he &apos;s willing to undergo a sexual transformation in which case he can stay alive .
the states of this species don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i spoke to a few years ago who had brought some siamesian twins to separate them , in part to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he was doing these surgeries -- they were highly risky surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children were being treated very poorly , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well did you consider political asyl rather than having surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states has incredible opportunities to allow people to be the people they are without having to change around the state of will .
so i think we need to be leadership .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities that democracy might look like , or could have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something radically to a feminist , which is , i think , that there may be different kinds of insights that govern different kinds of anatomy , especially when people apply group thinking .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in gender difference .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve seen from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- tend to give a lot of complex social relationships and concern for people who are vulnerable within the group .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my students asked me , who knew my interest in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist , so doing it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about dissolving stereotypes about gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be something female in feminism .
that is to say there could be something on average , which is what female brains are different from male , which makes us more attention to highly complex social relationships and more alert to the protective needs .
so where the founding fathers were extremely suspicious of figuring out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we could put more of a concept of , not just how to protect each other , but how to care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we &apos;re doing democracy about anatomy -- think less about the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships .
so if we as a people try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love being able to take another colorful , crazy outfit , and have been photographing and blogging recently .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on flew markets and in second-hand shops .
ooh , thank you .
second-hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe to the environment and also the influence of my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s shopping for my personal chest .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
will i like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers were yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase and tell you what i &apos;ve packed for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
i brought seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
underpants for exactly a week are all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i cried that i would find everything else i could carry if i came to palm springs first .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman walking around here at ted in her underwear -- that means i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my outfits this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to tell you some of the lessons that i believe or not , have learned from these adventurers to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
all this outfit , including the jacket , cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i worn all week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people to be happy .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and adapt at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re also going to estimate it .
wednesday , hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i look like i &apos;m playing &apos; dresses &apos; or i remember her seven-year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you look good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll summarize that for you briefly .
if you think you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailing matches everything .
and finally , saturday : developing a unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been proven over and over and over this week when people came to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , this is not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate all that again .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week myself is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to call these things emotionally , because right around the corner there will always be another crazy , colorful , bright outfit that just waiting for me if i have a little love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something here that i want to show you .
think of this as a visual point , as a flying point .
this is what we call perceptual design in our lab .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting happened in the formula 1 in the last decade .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s monitored in real time , has a few thousand sensors that information from the car , pass that information to the system , and then use it to change that car back in real time and make information .
this would be what you call , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made up of two parts -- a sensing part and a responsive arrow .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real-time control systems start to appear in our lives .
our cities have been , over the last few years , equipped with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the open .
and as a computer in the open , they start responding in a different way , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
when we build cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population are there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something to cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this perceive and drive into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli at moma later a year , organized during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there becomes a sensor and a grain .
and that radically transforms the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he finally took the hammer and threw it to moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot underneath -- and said , &quot; perché non parli ? why can &apos;t you say ? &quot;
well , today , our environment , for the first time , begins to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , perceiving and driving the idea of our environment .
let &apos;s start with perceivation .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and using anonymous and aggregated information from this network , which is now being collected by operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was like italy won the soccer championship of the world .
some of you will remember it was when italy played against france , and then finally zidane , the head shock .
and anyway , italy won at the end of it .
now look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see in the middle the colosseum , the tiver .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline on the top .
in the old afternoon , people here and there who are calling and moving .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
half-time , people make a brief phone call , go to the toilet .
second half-time . end of the normal game .
first extension , second .
zidane , in a moment of head shock .
italy wins . yeah .
now that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the great impact .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seventh team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the space about massimo , where since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
another quick example of feeling : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things we use and consume .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is made of , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so we actually designed some small markers in this project to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who helped us a little over a year ago in seattle marks the things they were throwing away -- different kinds of things you can see -- things that you would throw away anyway .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , glued into the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results we just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of inefficient in the system .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this happens to be a lot of unuseful trucks and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the tasks we throw away are not just disappearing that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re still throwing away every day .
and if we were to show that to people , then we can drive behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could perceive much more about that and the many other wonderful things you can perceive , tell you , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the concrete environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question from the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology to it ?
and one of the ideas that was mediated at mit in a workforce was imagine these tubes , and valves , magnet valves , valves , valves that open and close .
they do something like a water curtain with scores of water .
if these scores fall down , they can write on them , they can display patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it will open to make it jump through , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
he liked it very much .
and we got the mission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
we called it pavillion in the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but as you approach it , it will open up and let you go in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce syringes , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that day when you drive down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just so that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who wonders what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water up to not get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually that night it was even more fun .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to make it happen , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and this was very exciting for us , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people , the things we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interacting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical imaging points , the data points of water and the projections on it .
and this is what made us think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these imagery points could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopters flying through the air , and each of you with a little turning point of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter like the one you saw earlier , moving with others , totally in sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have some sort of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently in three dimensions where what changes is light , not the position of the imagery .
you can play with different types .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , different solutions .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of imaging points that you can go and pass through , that you can look at in many , many ways .
here you see a real flywire controller coming down to form an equal v like before .
when you turn on the light it looks like this , so the same as we saw before .
imagine that every single person is being controlled .
it could have a impulse to every single point that comes from people , from the movement of people or so forth .
i want to show you something first here .
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étoile at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in mailand -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a momentum for the flyfire .
this is roberto dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the imagery , the different captive impressions .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan and a motion recording at the same time .
so they can understand the whole movement .
you can do this all the time .
but then once we have all the imagery , they can play with it and play with color gravity and motion .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
again , the idea is , imagine building the cloud movement that we engage people again to do something and to change the environment -- almost as we call the clouds movement as you move a sheet out , but with a cloud .
imagine anybody can give a little donation to a point of view .
i think the remarkable thing about the last few years , the last decade , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the campaign obamas showed this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of networks to the physical world .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to face the challenges coming -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical ?
so the idea is that we actually engage people in the way that they do things , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of imaging points in the same way as a really cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of points .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with data points .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , divide out the most important moments for olympia of 2012 and darwin , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go to like london &apos;s new mountain summit .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital globe at night -- but most importantly , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important in context .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica about 10 years ago , where i saw my first iceberg .
i &apos;m frightened .
my heart was dizzy , as i tried to grab what was in front of me .
the icebergs raped around me almost 60 meters out of the water , and i could only stare that this was a snowflake on another snowflake by year .
ice mountains are born as a calf of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice sheets .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with their environment in a very clear way and their experience .
some refuse to give up and brace to the bitter end , while others stop and collapse dramatic passion in a case .
if you look at an iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re isolated , separated , and only , as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
as an iceberg melts , i breathe its precursor atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it melts out mineral drinking water that feeds many forms of life .
i go to my footage of these icebergs as if i make portraits of my ancestors , the awareness that they exist in this individual eye-looking of that way and will never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when they melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a continuation of their path along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the icebergs that i &apos;m facing is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images that i &apos;d like to show you are an iceberg that i &apos;ve encountered in kekertsuatsiak in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing an escalating iceberg .
so here it is .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the water line .
you can see here he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is standing there .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it takes about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , let &apos;s show you the iceberg another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely blessed by work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffiti artists of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs cribble . &quot;
and that was the eruption of the thing .
tempt is now completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i faced with him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and pay attention to in the art world .
so we decided to support tony -- tempt -- and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i haven &apos;t seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all of the paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you go to the higher social layer and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; butterfly and the diving bell &quot; ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along .
i said , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need to just take a check , and instead i made a check that i didn &apos;t know how to fix it .
i committed to his brother and father in place -- saying , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i met these guys at grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw with a laser pointer on it that only governs the negative surface .
so they move around and they make art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
it starts with the sex climbers , then the shots come , after that , the bush leverage and finally people do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and had dinner with my wife and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to control a laser so that it can be graffiti again . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached a few things .
first of all , we brought in the insurance of the doors , and we actually got a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawking machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda because you talk to him , or you get an email , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m so unworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also flew seven programmers from around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- home to us .
my wife and my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorist and archives have taken over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and we came back and all the images on the walls were graffitis .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the beach mall in venice , my kids were involved , and my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the beaches of venice , a little bit of copper wire and some things from the building market and the electronics trade .
we took a ps3-camera , we teamed it apart , put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s open -- you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , you can download the software for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can break .
no hospital .
any paralyzed now can actually communicate or draw alone with your eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this rumble in front of the big unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nudelparties and sewing through , tony first drew after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we tied his bed so he can look outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the parking lot in front of the hospital .
and he drew for the first time , in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what kind of feeling that was in the parking lot .
luckily , we also had to break in the parking lot , so we felt right as part of the spray scene .
in the end , he sent us an email with following content : &quot; for the first time in seven years , i &apos;ve done something .
i feel like i was crushed underwater , and finally somebody picked down and pulled my head up so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s something like our fight scream .
that keeps us going , and let &apos;s continue to evolve .
and we need to do much better on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic blackboard .
and someone who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all sorts of recognition .
we &apos;ve won some prices .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it all comes out of our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong tweeted about us and then , december , honored us time-magazine when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolest thing about this is -- and this closes the whole circle -- that this april , in the inner city of los angeles , there will be an exhibition called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the toughest representatives of the street scene -- banksy , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys will be there .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty deadly .
so basically , when you see something that &apos;s impossible , you make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augenerative technology , but i &apos;ve just captured something and surrounded myself with amazing people so we could put something together .
and that question was to ask each of you , and that &apos;s every single day when you have to get something done . if not now , when ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most common children &apos;s author .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get there like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but no one has ever chosen any farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingual .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started back in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the classrooms .
i was the one who was beaten in the virgin oids green and blue every week until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life using the toilet in the classroom .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i loved one -- and at the time in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to do a work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from this teacher in the middle of the night , woman post saying , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never known each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , please come together with the guy i know you &apos;ve found him now .
and i should mention that i have pancreatic cancer , and i want you to hurry please . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight because they needed it .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , met me , she turned into a box of ash and was put in my hands .
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation i talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned so often here today .
he needs the same thing -- he would need love and pleasure , and it &apos;s up to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you go up to 1,000 meters .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a power plant that would clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one to talk to the airport .
so i looked at her in a second , and they said , &quot; no problem , i think we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already memorized the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot did the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it shuts down the engine .
imagine a noisy airplane .
and then he said three words -- the lowest words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; make it available . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borders anymore .
i could see it in her eyes , there was a horror that life ended .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to hand and didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to flick , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
as i later thought about it , i found a phrase that says , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is there and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to move anything more in life .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and that was when we missed the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair breadth -- i thought , boy , there &apos;s one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i aspire to become better in everything i attacked .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
and i took the time that i wasted for meaningless things with people who mean something .
and i thought of the relationship with my wife , my friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to get negative energy out of my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i was no longer arguing with my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right anymore ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- while the inside clock starts counting &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break up in 20 parts , as you know it from documentaries .
as we fall down , i had this feeling of dying , man , is not terrifying .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really formed in one thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
about a month after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- first graders , not much artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
i realized back then by connecting the dots to each other that life is all about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
i became part of the wonder of not dying that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
my call for those of you who fly today is : imagine the same thing happening on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you shoot because you think you &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents they can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for developing nuclear weapons is the uran-incentive facility in natance .
the gray boxes you see here , these are real-time control systems .
now if we manage to compete the systems that control files and valves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective windows virus on a laptop that &apos;s used by a warning engineer to configure this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows drone .
the usage is transferred into the gray box , damages the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear energy program -- mission .
this is a children &apos;s game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started studying stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the meaning and purpose of this construction was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated in terms of the windows , the dropper- part , made by countless cero-- day- scholar use .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
that brought our attention , and we started a lab project where we got infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet was like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniffed out , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my mind .
and after experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i realized this was a targeted attack .
completely focused on a particular goal .
the droplet is active on the gray box when a special configuration was discovered , even when the special program that it &apos;s trying to infect on that target .
and if not , then there &apos;s nothing going to do .
so that really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it may , for example , be an u.s. power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so we extracted and decompulated the attack code and found that it &apos;s structured in two digital warheads -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professionally constructed by people who obviously had all insider information available .
they knew all bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they probably even knew the size of the machine operator .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already been told that the student drug is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , use data is a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much harder than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this captured code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned assembly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for was system-functioning calls because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we looked for timers and data structures and tried to connect them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could record or disprove .
to put these theories up , we call ourselves remembered that it &apos;s definitely high-graded sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infections have been reported there .
well , there aren &apos;t several thousand goals in this area .
it &apos;s basically running out of the buree nuclear power plant and the incentive plant in natance .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centrifuge and power plants from our client tribe . &quot;
and i called her , and i tapped her knowledge to compare her expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital warheads to the rotorturing system .
the rotor is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and eventually even explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was to actually make it happen slowly and secretly -- obviously in the attempt to keep warning engineers desperate so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind quickly .
the great digital warhead -- we got a glimpse of it by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 164 is really out of this code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
i started working on scientific literature about how these centrifuges are built in natance , and found that they &apos;re structured in what &apos;s called cascades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuge .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got even better .
these centrifuge in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the code of attack ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , the fit really well together .
and this gave us a lot of confidence in what we &apos;re studying here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a dead gas and had to recollect us .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads were actually controlling the same goal , but from different directions .
the little warhead takes over a cascade , and rolls the rotors and slows them down , and the big head comes with six cascades in interaction and manipulate valves .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s natance , and it &apos;s just natance .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really taken me out of the socks .
down there is the gray box , and on top you see the centrifuge .
now , what this thing does is it captures the subtle values of sensors -- which is , for example , from pressure sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitimate code running during the attack , with false data .
and in fact , this false data of stuxnet is already taken before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where , during the chase , the surveillance system is fed with previous video footage .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea here , obviously , is not just checking the machine operators in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overlook a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine operator can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , when the big steam turbine becomes too fast , you have to open deposit valves within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and if they &apos;re at risk , bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and not the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
it has nothing to do with centrifuge , with uranization .
so for example , he would work just as well -- in a power station or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generous .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the usb data on a usb stick , as we saw at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and when you do that , you end up with a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to imagine .
so unfortunately , the biggest target for those attacks is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most targeting environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we start to prepare better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , a lot of it was reported that people suspect the mossad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mosquito is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind that is cyber-power .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for chasing us a married fear . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time are kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i set out to be the biggest part of my career in terrible situations , and all of this for trying to do is to study social failure so that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way understandable what makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i was going to come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that a few weeks ago i did an ad on ebay .
i sent some facebook news , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to get nameless rights at my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , got the unprecedented opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go again -- to buy nameless rights on the talk that you &apos;re seeing at that moment didn &apos;t have a title or a lot of content or a lot .
so what you got was this : your name presented here : my tedtalk you have no idea what the topic is going to be , and that could fly to your ears after content , especially if i &apos;m in charge of your company .
but besides that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people watch these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the job titles , by the way .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy nameless rights .
now , if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we &apos;re looking at the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , over the years , i entered some pretty awful situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could upset me to go to anything as difficult and as dangerous as these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film about placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the record ever before . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the ever-time &quot; is that everything from above to bottom , everything from the beginning to the end , is totally covered with brands -- from the cover sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand xke .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the state center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to concrete .
it was &quot; in perpetuity forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have brand x as a title sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every category that &apos;s possible in the movie .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the ever-time &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a sense of &quot; the time ever before . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are a part of life , actually , get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of stats .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i &apos;d be happy if ceg was going to help do that .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how powerful people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that has a negative notation -- but do you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth addressing some really famous brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a horror people .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the film or a difficult thing to do for me ?
jk : both .
... so , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
there are some places we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera out &quot; would mean we wanted to have a backup conversation .
it turns out it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your movie . &quot;
and just so those companies disappeared , one by one .
no one wanted to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole idea of advertising was to present your product to as many people as possible , let as many people see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , in this intersection of new and old media and fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting medium tool that the masses bring that message .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal error , and that was the following .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture represents is a problem .
see , if you type transparency in google search , this is -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your species , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- freely from deception and bag , just detect and straight ; instantly understandably , characterized by visibility and access to information , especially in terms of business language -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it gets there , it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , who still breeds .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole shell cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , my father caught me lying -- and there he is , looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but since only one company , an agency has been willing to help us -- and it &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to go around the middle man and go directly with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a comprehensive problem .
i have friends who make big , gigantic hollywood movies , and i have friends who make small , tone movies like me .
and my friends , who make great , gigantic hollywood movies , say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have .
and then my friends , who make little bath movies , say , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the record ever before . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see in the movie ?
whenever i get on my way , and whenever i open the medical drank , you &apos;ll see deban dedorant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
either florn fusion or paradise winds , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for both men and for women -- solid , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short socket .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you an exquisite constitution .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a challenger brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so doing these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
in what words would you describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
abandoned technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the bowls .
we talk about chicken , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes too positive , as opposed to &quot; fight odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million-company .
what about me ? what about print types ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , otto-normal consumers .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothing .
1980s revival hits scateral points , except on friday .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray colors and stuff .
but i usually have an accessible like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff like that .
if dan were a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes cabrio .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , reliable fly .
woman 2 : partly hippie , parts yogi , partly brooklyn-girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum guy .
i sell scholars all over the country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was an exposure .
man 5 : brand failed alcohol addictive writing .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a stamp .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand , but i often see myself in the interface of dark glamour and neglect fly .
and what i realized was that i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could invade my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the branding personality .
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
they have helped companies like nests , feathers , hallmark to discover this trademark personality .
if they could do it for them , they could certainly help me .
they brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people that shape my view of the world .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and stuff .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me came and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about why -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machete ? what puppet stadium are they at now ?
why is it important to restart ? what &apos;s the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what other metamorphosis did they go through ?
... this doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you in ?
eeee ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her brand personality separated two , but it separated full pages -- the morgan spurlockless brand is an eightful one brand .
they do very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoiding things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and they &apos;re welcome , and they actually turn them into something positive for themselves , and that &apos;s a layered move .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini cooper and jetblue .
well , there &apos;s tracking brands and eightful brands , these things that come and go , but one played , eight marks is a pretty strong thing .
an eightful , played brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be like ?
you &apos;re an up-attribute ? are you something that brings blood into whales ?
or are they more like a down toll ?
are you something a little bit more calm , reservative , conservative ?
up-attributes are things that are playful , fresh like the fresh prince , contemporary , adventurous , failed and lovely like erol flynn , agile , glorious , magical and mystical , like gandalf .
or are they more like a down attribute ?
are you mindful and monumn like 007 ?
are they established , traditionally , nurturing , protective , compassionate like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , family , safe , native , sacred , considerable and wise like the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the film , we had over 500 companies that were up and down companies and they said no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything to that movie because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but they found 17 brand partners who were willing to give attention to this control that would do business with somebody as care and act as i did , and who would finally enable us to tell stories that we wouldn &apos;t have normally been able to do -- stories that a advertiser would never be supported .
they enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that today you use mri to pin the air centers of the brain to make both advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo where outdoor advertising had been banned .
all over the city , there has been no timeline , no poster , no flyer , nothing for five years .
and we drove in school districts where companies were tracking their way into impoverished schools across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i got the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went to the middle man , they went around the agencies , and they said that maybe the agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our world is challenging .
and what did that do for you ? what did it succeed ?
well , since the film had premiered at the sundance film festival , we can look at that .
according to burrelle , the premiere one in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this movie .
this actually includes just a two-and-a-half weeks &apos; period .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been delivered yet .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no streaming online .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
well , finally , the film has gained a very large momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad agency we talked to has recommended its customer to let the fingers go .
one of the things that i firmly believe is that when you take your chance , you take risks , you get these risks .
i think if you keep people from doing it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you prepare the whole company to gain profit .
i feel like as people move forward , we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not be scared of opportunities they might scare .
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
a big spoon full , this is how we welcome the risk .
and finally , let &apos;s welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty brings us very far .
and that was said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; welcome transparency , &quot; was presented to you by my good friends of emc , who paid 7100 dollars for the name rights on ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world into great opportunities .
emc presents &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what happened to the $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i did a check in my pocket , put it on the top of the ted organization , the sapling foundation -- a check up at 7100 dollars to fund my ted next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i talked about doing something with museums and art , and my chefin , which is also today , gave me a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , at 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on leadership .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t complain -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many museums and those artworks .
so when i was traveling and visiting these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire -- make art more accessible -- to bring technology together .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since we started .
so you just go to google project.com.
you can look around in all these museums here .
there &apos;s uffizi , moma , the hermitage , the rijk , the van gogh .
i even come to one of my favorite ones , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you walk around and you amuse yourself .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in it , they want to go to the end of the gang .
just further . lots of fun .
clean it up .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , tar workers of beeter breugel in the met .
i see this pluses .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click that now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been stuck with the so-called gigapix technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion points of imagery , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can zoom in very easily and out .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i got up close , and i realized slowly these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit , spoke to some familiar met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a whole day is beaten with a stick on the fast-day basis .
it seemed quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned a little bit about it .
to get really close , you can go to your cracks .
just to give you the overview , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump to moma quickly , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
the previous example was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the strokes of the paintbrush ?
and what only if you want to see van gogh creating this masterpiece ?
you zoomed in . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorite climbers of this picture until i &apos;m really in the cracks .
this is starring night , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many others , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , everyone -- if you have rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- don &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- out of all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
very simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the zoom -- you can zoom around .
this is &quot; the abandoned , &quot; in the national stalallery .
you can miss everything with suggestions , send your friends , and such a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , to me , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums , i think .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to talk to this digital medium of art , and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question i get asked recently is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it should fill the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
this is the left half that &apos;s the logical side and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a measure of the aptitudes of each hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , would this be somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain at that scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high aptitute that is also in both hemisphere .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or whatever .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good percentage of logic to bring together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually execute experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then see how it responds , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that at the same time a thing can be just in one place .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea ; they designed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a floor threshold .
he was another toddler , and not very good at it , and he kept falling .
but i bet that playing with the threshold taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that the big stuff doesn &apos;t just leave you over , and that it stays in a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with soil vibrations , but they &apos;re playing with these little strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover all kinds of weird things -- like they fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of a few years ago ; it took quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but it didn &apos;t take them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play with particles that often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
because if all these things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t all be the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i &apos;d feel better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i set out to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
here , i &apos;ll expand it a little bit . we &apos;re looking right here at the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal shaped like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new silicons , and i racked on all the big devices for 100 hours .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of swimming pool and this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i stop doing all these things because i don &apos;t want to bother them with it , or , frankly , they disappear .
so quantum mechanics says that unmovable objects feel the same way .
the co-drivers for intractable objects are not just people , but the light that shines on them and the wind that &apos;s sweeping on them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal was changing quantum mechanically , we had to kick all the mites out .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , put it in a vacuum and sucked all the air and cooled it up until almost now on the elevator alone , the piece of metal was free to act like it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it was moving really strange .
instead of just being quiet there , it was vibrating . the way it was vibrating was something like this -- like a expanding and blowing bubble balg .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vibrate it at the same time and not vibrate it -- something that only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you right now is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time to vibrate and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that make up the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down .
just for precise times they agree .
for the rest of the time , they &apos;re delocalized .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different places , which at the same time means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth sleeping for all this year in the clean room , because , you know , the difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why can &apos;t it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re in many places at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with your body being delocalized in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we warm it up and turned the lights on and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really just agonized objects that are made together in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more of that . it &apos;s even deeper .
it turns out that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should reconceptualize how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , they want to be able to choose between at least one hand of different cities all in competition to new residents .
we are right now far from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who are not even available a single city that would welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than they &apos;re costing them .
so we could very easily deal with the world , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , so you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just swap out the construction of apartments against cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in apartments did this already ; the other half don &apos;t .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what they would be willing to engage in these apartments and their environment to avoid complaining and to distract from building .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to understand all these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new block of housing , predicted the laws there would support such a construction and not prevent it .
so i proposed that governments can create new surfaces that will provide enough space for a city and give you a name : charter cities .
i later discovered that , roughly the same time , jafour and octavio , were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 hondurans left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
at this point , jafour said to octavio , &quot; what happens if we take a blank area of our country -- what if we just gave them a message of the american embassy -- some of the canadian bottlenecks -- and if people want to go to work under the united states or the canadian ecraft ?
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered from a profound declaration crisis .
in the next planned elections , pepe lobo won in a turnaround whose program was both new and also disputing .
he demanded octavio to become his stable .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and use it through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to the fundamental elements .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that determine already existing housing owners cannot be disturbed .
we give new technologies great attention , but for progress it takes technologies and laws , and it &apos;s common laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him jafour .
they called me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in a hotels sitting in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they are at cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , and remember that in some cases a surface is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk represented in very simple form that a charter city is a place whose early uninhabited country is a founding contract that determines the laws that are there , and people are willing to choose to live either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is to move forward .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and give a lecture on the fourth and fifth of january .
so i gave another filled talk with facts that included a graph like this that tries to show that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of denver , and the sketch represents the new airport built in denver .
this airport alone has a area of 100 square kilometers .
so i tried to convince hondurans if you want to build a new city , you have to start an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s over 250 thousand acres .
politely , everybody applauded .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
the director of the congress came on stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the core statement that a new city offers new opportunities to people .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras instead of hundreds of kilometers away in the north .
and a new city includes new possibilities for leaders as well .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the help of partnership countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that would help them set up the laws for this charter and the permission that anyone could really trust that the charter would be implemented .
and the realization of president lobo was that the certainty of the translation that i thought about could be one way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city equally relevant for all the parties in honduras that have been under fear and distrust for many years .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it captures a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after , on january 19th , they voted congress for a change in constitution to have a comprehensive policy that is reliable for special development areas .
in a country that has just been elected to a massive crisis in congress for this change in 124 to a voice .
all parties , all the questions in society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , the second time it was approved with 114 to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and february 24th , a delegation of about 30 famans traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in rising into the business of the city .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center built in south korea , big than the city of bostons .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the approval .
the other place that was very interested in building cities is singapore .
there have already been two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a piece of construction , and they already mention this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been worked on a legal system that managers are allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also worked on an external legal system .
a country has already offered its supreme court to be a court for the abundant job of the legal system in the court .
also , urban designers and construction are very interested .
they even bring money into it .
one thing , as you know , has already been resolved , there are many tenants .
there are a lot of operations that would love to look at in america , especially in a place with a free zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who say they want to live permanently in a different place .
a million people are leaving latin america every year and migrating to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families back to find work -- sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who &apos;ve been trying to find their parents again that they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen their parents for a decade .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about building a whole new city in honduras ?
or even building stupid of these cities , or giving out hundreds of them all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between multiple cities in competition around new residents ?
that &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that makes a typical american person a day is 70th .
and also , a recent study of ceos where they saw ceos for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different issues that these ceo is doing , and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is dealing with 139 tasks a week .
each of these topics , of course , was made of many , many smaller decisions .
fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions do you make in the nine minutes of category versus those in an hour &apos;s category ?
how good do you think are you in dealing with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest policy-making problems of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some of the possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hand , because i &apos;m blind , only if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the overload problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grocery store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure savings .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and this was at a time when we actually drunk water .
i loved going to this business , but at one point i wondered , well , how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil going .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from thousands of year-old olive trees .
so one day i decided to go to the box box , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he pointed at the buses of tourists who came every day and used to have their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marker gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we set up a little cooperation right at the entrance of business .
we put six different flavor directions of marmelade or 24 different flavors of marmelade , and we looked at two things : first of all , what case would i be more people standing and trying marmelade ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent , than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what case people were more likely to buy a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the reverse effect .
of the people who stayed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
of the people who stayed when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of marmelade .
now , when you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass of marmelade who you had six choices than if you had 24 choices .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waistline -- but it turns out that decision-making problems also affect us in very sequencing decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
so on the subject of the day , financial saving .
now i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with gur huberman , emyself kamenica , wei jang , where we looked at the decisions of savings plans for the retirement of almost one million americans of about 650 plans all over the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fondsans that were possible for a retirement plan , the 401 plan , affects the probability of saving more tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a relationship .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that allowed people to do anything between two to 59 different fonds .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered , in fact , the less part of the story .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that were offering two fonds , they had a seventh rate in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fonds , the participation rate now dropped to about the 60s percent .
now it turns out that even if you &apos;re unlocked , when there &apos;s more choices to choose , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate tend to have more opportunities available to them , the more they rented it into action and fund .
the more opportunities they had , the more they put all their money into pure money .
none of these extreme decisions , are part of the decisions someone would recommend if their future financial welfare is important to us .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences in humans that offer more and more choices to themselves .
they shoot the decision -- push it up , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they make more bad decisions -- worse financial and worse medical choices .
they choose more for things they make less satisfied themselves , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that perhaps we enjoy looking at these huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essig and marmelade , but in fact we can &apos;t compare and border and then actually choose something from the fantastic bot .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- that they can just apply in their business .
first , narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today that less is more .
people are always disturbed when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing space .
but in fact , we see it ever more and more that if you &apos;re willing to narrow , and the unimportant equal possibilities get rid of , well , there &apos;s a increase in sales , the cost is brought down , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement in the perception .
when proctor and gamble reduced the different head and the different types of head to 15 , they experienced a increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of her 10 best selling katzenstreus , they experienced that the gains went up at 87 percent -- a result of both sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average supermacrt today offers 45,000 products .
a typical walmart offers you 100,000 products today .
but the near-largest supermarket in the world today is aldi , and they only offer you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came out of the market is how best you mandate the choices was something that david laibson has done very well , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s being offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now automatically participate in a lifetimes fund .
those who really want to make a choice are offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the question is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t keep them apart , their customers can &apos;t . &quot;
now before we started this afternoon , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer a single vacation to the most beautiful street in this audience .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read them to you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read it , and then i &apos;ll ask you to clap it if you &apos;re ready to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
okay . anyone who &apos;s ready to accept gary &apos;s offer .
are they all ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you saw objectively , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would like to guess you &apos;d feel it more real than the second time you got it .
because the pictures made it real feeling for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps them deal with the problem of overload decision-making , which is concrete .
it &apos;s about people , in order to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what the consequences are associated with individual possibilities , and that these consequences have to be vidly and concrete .
why do people on average spend 15 to 30 percent more if they use a ec-map or a credit card than barmoney ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like we &apos;re paying .
and it turns out that if you manage something to feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we did a study i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro feltero , and we did a study with the people at ing -- employees who worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they had their participation .
and during that gathering , we inherited this meeting just as it used to be , we added a little thing to it .
the small thing that we added was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a 20 percent increase in participation , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save or an increase in four percent by the amount they were willing to pay for the savings account .
third technology : categorization .
we can deal with more categories than more choices .
for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine gang .
it turns out that in the away mans supermarkets up and down in the northeast area , the number of 31 different papers varied from high to 64 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and put them into 10 categories or i &apos;m showing you 400 magazines , and i &apos;m going to split them into 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given them more choices and a better selection experience than i would give you the 400 other than i had given them the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to hold them apart .
here are two different smudges .
one is called jazz , and the other is called swing .
if you think the left display is swing , and the ad on the right is jazz , you clap your hands .
okay , there are a few .
if you think that &apos;s jazz on the left , and that , on the right side , is swing , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly unuseful categorization scheme .
the categories have to tell the selector something , not to provide the choice .
and this is a problem that you often see when you look at the long lists of all these fund .
who do you actually want to inform with it ?
my fourth technique : predicting complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we just have to simplify it .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that offers you the ability to configure your car completely itself .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices they provide per decision .
car color , foreign color of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
now what i do is i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half the customers go from the many possibilities of 56 car colors to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers go from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice for choice , it means you &apos;re overwhelmed , the hottest , i &apos;m losing it .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who go from many to low probability dough over and over again choose standard choice .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then you stay there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is presented .
when i start with the simple one , i learn how to choose .
even though the gear is selecting me , nothing about my preferences at interior equipment , it &apos;s still preparing me to choose .
it also excites me about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m ready to motivate myself to be interested in this .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are milking the problem of decision overload -- limited -- are the obsolete alternatives , concrete -- make it real ; categorizing -- we can handle better categories , less opportunities ; we can address complexity .
each of these techniques that i describe to you today is thought to help you manage the possibility -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that if you choose , you &apos;re selective .
and the more we choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-managers on youtube , and i look at youtube videos for a living .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video becomes viral , and then finally , why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but webvideos have allowed us all , or all of our creative activities , to be terribly famous in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet until next saturday .
but youtube is uploaded over 48 hours of video per minute .
it &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever becoming viral and is looked at thousands of times and such a cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , seammates and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
ohhhhhhhhh , wowww !
last year , vasquez sent this video that he had filmed before his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the last summer .
in fact , never really wanted to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share one rainbow .
because this is what you do when you call yosemite mountain mesh .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmy kimmel sent the tweet who ended up making the video so popular .
because tastemaker , like jimmy kimmy kimmel , imagine new and interesting things and show a big audience .
it &apos;s friday . friday . gotta get down on friday everybody . &apos; willingness to the weekend , weekend . friday . friday . getin down friday . you didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks is one of the most popular video of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like the &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have come out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also fridays .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 put it on , lots of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from the myth theater was a first person to twitter about it .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of tastemaker took a standpoint , shared with a large audience , accelerated the process .
and then this community of people who shared this big joke and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10,000 parodias of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
there was a parody for every single day in the first seven days .
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , the community &apos;s participation is to become our way of becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new from it .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it &apos;s been looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version of it that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
what &apos;s important is that creativity is dominated in the internet culture of technology and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
an entire remix community shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something we can all participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find enjoyment of something , we do .
who could have looked forward to all this ?
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat ? &quot;
what are the scripts that you can write where this is supposed to be ?
in a world where every minute there &apos;s two days of video being uploaded , only really unique and unexpected can emerge as the videos i mentioned .
i admit , i was not particularly interested when a friend said to myself , i should look at this great video , about a guy protesting in new york against tickets for bicycles .
i got a ticket because i didn &apos;t drive on the bike path , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive on the bike path .
since this was completely surprising and humorous , casey niestats were viewed funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true of anything new that we do creative .
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
ohhhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and determines the audience more popular .
as i said , one of the greatest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning on youtube .
nobody has to give their ideas green light .
and today we all feel ourselves as owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re also hardly hitting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connection between women about three generations in 10 minutes , and how the astonishing strength of this connectedness manifest itself in the lives of a four-year-old girl &apos;s life , than she was living in a small sister , her mother and her grandmother , five days and nights ago , and a little girl in a bowl .
history is not over yet .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of it as a march of communication in saigon , as it must say , his life has been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , now his friends spoken .
he removed to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that history was trying to crush us , but we were missing it .
the next puzzle piece shows how a boat is running in the early morning morning lens at sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an arrangued marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , life had asked her a question : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was totally excluded that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and film rubber saga glitt , a boat still targeted as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
they were terrified of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was carrying a little poison bottle .
in a prisoner , my sister and i had only drunk her and my grandmother from her .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady tuckers of the engine , the clapping of every wave on the bug , the long and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came in many times , but went from the death courage of the men on our boat or the incidence of the engine who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil spill off the malayan coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted like this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations who together build a new life .
we settled down in footscray , one of the working class inhabited suburbs whose population is made out of immigrant layers .
unlike the out-of-the-box suburbs that had been completely unknown to me , there was no challenge in footscray .
the framework from the trucks came from the rest of the world .
and the fatty of english was exchange between people who had one thing in common : they started again .
my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , double layers .
she somehow managed to find her time to get english and it qualifications .
we were poor .
every dollar was divided and put into more education for english and mathematics no matter what we had to deal with , and most of the time the new things that came from second hand .
two stretches for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the cracks , because it had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but painful chaustries of &quot; nasty eye &quot; and there and there are tapestries : &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
home where ?
something went up to me .
there was a meeting about reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get you out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat in nightmares .
and my job was to stay awake every night until their nightmares came up so i could wake them up .
she opened up a computer business , then made a cosmetic education and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t make change , angry and inflexible , and cared children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searched .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student who hired inexhaustible demands on himself .
in the other hand , i was wrapped in uncertain lives , wore the tragic scars of violence , of drug abuse and insulation .
but so many got help over the years .
and because of that help , i was mentioned in my last year of law school as a young australian of the year .
and i was catapulted from one puzzle piece to the next catapulture , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous user of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to speak to places she &apos;d never heard of , and dwellings whose existence she could never have imagined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the etiquette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of life of an unknown ancestor -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were as closed as they were for 20 years by telling and sleeping each other the stories of their day , we still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that now i was as old as they did when we stepped the boat .
no , there was no way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about jugendary and education , and the neglect of marginalized and disenfranchised .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all living systems , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of the possible .
and although i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t take a career in jura .
there had to be another puzzle piece .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a novelty , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something to be grateful for , perhaps a gift of the boat .
because belonging can lead so easily to the collapse of the horizon can mean so easily you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve now gone from my convenience to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not the way you fear it .
possibilities that were not allowed were explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , an inexhaustible optimism , a strange mixture of humility and wagging .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a small team of people around me , for the shoe blade , &quot; not &quot; an inconsistent challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of every day , i cooked a huge top soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant people in it , and we made the breakthrough .
i made a decision to move to the united states .
after just one journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure continued .
before i close this talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her own .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
without her husband &apos;s support , she worried for a conversation by bringing him to court and claim in her own case , and a greater conversation than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; proved to be untrue .
i was just shooting in a hotel room in sydney when she died , 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the shower wall and saw it standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories and made her make sure we were still with her .
at midnight the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been keeping them this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through women .
you see who we were and how life shaped us now we can see that the men who might have come into our lives would have come into us .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , of ease , of counseling .
can i give you a bug in your life that cares bold every wave that drives unbiting , steady tuckers of the engine , the large horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that and surely get it through , i would .
also , tans &apos;s mother is in the fourth or fifth row here today .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it photography at all ?
because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography began when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
i combined it with my earlier preference for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera , the process was actually in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you put it on the triggers .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about going in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the trigger is expressed .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and still , still , a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and colorful at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i always want to make it look like you could have done that in a picture .
photographs where you have to think for a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes perspective is an illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be tangible in a two-dimensional space .
it &apos;s not what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we all relate to in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three dimensions like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we are missing our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , things around us in our everyday lives .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but they can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined pictures should have the same perspective .
secondly , to have combined pictures of the same lighting type .
and these two pictures meet these two demands -- shot out of the same altitude and the same lighting type .
three is about making it impossible to tell where the individual images begin and end by connecting seamlessly .
make it impossible to say how this photograph was actually put together .
so by comparing color , contrast and brightness to the edges of individual images , photographer blemishes combined like roadrunner , delicate colors and disorders , we will wipe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photograph , although a picture can basically contain hundreds of the size of it .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan it , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a smooth trip .
the bank is from another place .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even reverse the house up on the island of red to make it look swedish .
so to achieve a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going beyond me to design .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the various images .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well-planned .
and when you do good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that limics us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects fail .
and i think the most important point about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the radboud university was to set up a major listener .
and she doesn &apos;t do it very scientifically -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how &apos;s it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think this is one of the main problems why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic health projects are missing : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button / off .
and every morning i jumped on it .
and yeah , i have a problem , as you might recognize .
i did my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simply : every time i jump on the scale , it sends my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also called up by my general doctor so that he can see where my weight problem is , and that &apos;s not just where i need cardiological support or whatever , but also with a view of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you may know , i have over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning i jumped on my wlan-waage , and people are talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little salad today , lucia . &quot;
but this is the nicest thing that can happen because this is the peer coercion , group forced to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could take patients off smoking .
it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play some kind of game together to control their health better .
the next week , this is coming to the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little blood pressure measurement device that you attach to an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send them to their doctor and share it with others , for example , more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in , and not only can they take control , be captain on their own ship , but can help us face the challenges that are ahead of us , and the free explosion of health care , double demand , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use and start embracing patients on the team .
and they can do that through these sorts of ways , but also crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you a short video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around maastricht .
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
we asked about it , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where to find the next life-saving aed at that moment .
so what did we do ? we crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see an aed , please tell us where it is when it &apos;s up , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during business , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have already been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we made an ipad app .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and somebody collapses , you can use your iphone , and also in the next weeks your microsoftware cell phone to find the next aed that can save your life .
and by now , we want to do this not just as aed4u , what the product is called an aed4us .
and we want to get this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like knot points to crowdsource these aeds all over the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and somebody collapses , whether you &apos;re your own relatives or somebody else , you can find an aed like this .
the other thing we want to ask for is that companies around the world help us acknowledge these aeds .
these might be odd services , for example , or technicians , just to make sure that the melted aed is still in its place .
please help us improve health not just a little bit , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar technology .
and my little startup wants us to make an environmentalist protection by ...
... crowdsourcing is paying attention .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it might take a while it &apos;s invited .
now -- we can just jump over -- i &apos;ll just jump over the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much what they actually hate , we &apos;ve made them work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s kind of like the peacekeepers for computer freaks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with city administrations .
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re sending them into city users .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is show what technology is possible today .
so you meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s freezing him when he &apos;s screened because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter snow .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year in the train of the code for america .
they were there in february , and there was a lot of work going on last february .
and they realized that the city never releases these hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik michael &apos;s obese , noticed something else , and that was that residents were free-raising the sidewalks right in front of these parts .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydrant .
you agree with him freely when he sells .
if you do that , you can name it , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps written by the fellows last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of honolulu , who saw that he could use these app , not for snow , but for the citizens to adopt tsunici sirens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the clogged gullys .
and chicago just introduced them to get people out of the bureaucracy when it &apos;s fast .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use these app .
and it &apos;s spread rubbish , organic , of course .
when you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work that way .
the funding of software usually takes a few years .
we had a team working on a project last year in boston that took three and a half months to do this .
it was about a method where parents can figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were told later that if it had been about the normal canals , it would have taken over two years and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
there &apos;s a project right now in california justice that &apos;s cost the taxpayer two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spreads from sels is kind of a shot before the bug on the institution of the government .
it shows how government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think it should work .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , at this app , it represents a new generation that attacks the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sounded institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to effectively tackle things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country writing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with it , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost out of their eyes .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about is government , at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we can &apos;t do together alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people abandoned the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is changing .
and because the government ultimately exhausts its power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought the government was mostly about picking people into office .
now after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about municipal rats .
this is the call center for service and information .
that &apos;s where you usually get out if you &apos;re calling in your city 311 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , they all do this -- you &apos;ll see that people calling the government for many different problems , including a rat .
so scott gets this fertilizer .
he type &quot; thylacine &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal beginner .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is skin ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the marsupial rats .
it &apos;s not just a call center in boston .
it has an app , a web and cell app , called citizens connect .
we didn &apos;t write the app .
this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban mechanics in boston .
one day -- this is a actual report -- this came in : &quot; marsupial rat in my trash bin . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
scott talked from human to human .
but on &quot; citizens connect , &quot; it &apos;s all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the trash ton behind the house .
marsupial rats ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the trash ton on the page . went home .
good night , sweet marsupial rats . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to crowdsource the government .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government here played a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have joined them with government services if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if one night helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal beginner , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things we need to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s one input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we recline and we expect the government to reflect our values and our needs , and then we don &apos;t change much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15 inches .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use that word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contemplation that this thing that we own , for which we pay , makes something work against us , something else , and then we deconstruct ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to do bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual government work is happening .
we have to rely on the government machine .
so the occupythesia movement did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of troubled citizens who wrote a very detailed 325-page report that &apos;s an answer to the sec memo about the financial reform .
this is not politically active , this is bureaucratic .
now , for those of us who &apos;ve given up the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
do we really believe that we do what we need to do without improving an institution that can act on behalf of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally reframe government function in a way that can actually achieve something by reinventing society .
and there &apos;s one generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up looking at their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make your mind , on every channel at any time , and you do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
and these apps let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be to release a hydrant , to weed unseen , to turn a trash can with a marsupial rat .
and surely , we could have released these hydrants all the time , and a lot of people would have done that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government who pay taxes and benefits .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , are we going to be just a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands as well ?
thank you .
usually my role in explaining to people how wonderful new technologies that have come up will be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s going on , with these incredible jumps , that we can barely tell you .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , boring slide .
... you could just show the slide for a moment .
this is a slide i randomly chose from my folder .
i &apos;m not here about the details of the slide , but rather the general shape .
this slide shows us data from an analysis of the performance of risc processors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some others , which we often find in our field , is a kind of semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a potential in the performance scale .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy scale on semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could put the lights back on .
a little bit more bright , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now why do we draw graphers in technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
and the reason for that is , if i were to draw it on a normal curve , where , say , these are the years , so the timeline of a way , and this is an arbitrary degree of technology that i want to represent with a graph , the graph becomes silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say , a transportation technology , it would be on the semi-logarithmic scale very insensible in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the quality of the situation .
so if the transportation technology were going to continue as fast as the microprocessor technology , we could get in a taxi tomorrow and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
this has never happened before in the history of technology development , this kind of recursive growth , where scale increases exponentially every few years .
now the question i &apos;d like to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you see they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything will evolve forever and forever .
there are two possibilities .
it either becomes a classic curve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
is that true , then that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself is how this new world &apos;s going to be ?
what is this new state that the world is starting to do ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle .
when i was another kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people would often talk about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize the future is still at 2000 .
moving beyond that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future has shrunk about a year since i am in the world .
i think the reason we find that there &apos;s something going on .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s just not going to make sense right now to try and look 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple high-computation of what we &apos;re just now making no sense of .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
to do that , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the earth &apos;s scale .
i think the overall picture makes sense if you divide it into a few billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile stone clumps with many floating chemicals .
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did that .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how things started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of it , which is that at that time , little oil droplet was webbing which were different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
some of these oil droplet contained a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow .
everybody who was like that started dividing .
these little oil dropts were the most primitive cell form in the sense .
but these oil drops were not alive in the sense of today , because each one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals in it have spread to an unequal amount of stuff .
so each droplet was slightly different .
in fact , the droplet grew , which had one for growth optimally painted composition faster than others and more chemicals integrated from outside and divided faster .
so these tends to survive longer , and they expanded to scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it gets more interesting when these trucks learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , these trucks have learned the ability to write information down .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this insane evolutionary way that allowed them to write down what they were made of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of information to store over the course of 2.5 billion years when it came out remained the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
every being uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are so far that we can write only for the purpose of pleasure , even in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micrograms of a white powder here , which i try to hold in airports of security staff .
it &apos;s in there -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i amplified it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
in fact , if i had been an ego , i would have written it on a virus and released it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the defeat of dna was an interesting step .
and that made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step happened , where things became completely different , and that was these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities emerged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the consistency of antibiotics grows .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin and put this information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now that communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a certain sense the same boat ; they were synertic .
so they either survived together , or they went under them , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more often and preferred by evolution .
the transitional site is now where these communities are so close to each other that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community into a chain of draw on the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point we have multi-cellular communities , communities of many different cell entypes , which are functioning together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-celled community .
we have many cells that are no longer self-assembled .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evolve so that the level that evolution took place was no longer the individual cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
the next step happened in these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that did nothing but process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built up .
they started to form specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understand and capture information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning has happened within the period of life of a single organism , instead of this evolutionary period .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit , for example , because it tasted badly and made him sick the last time he ate it .
now this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years before that , because this information had to be evolutionarily learned by the individuals who died because of this fruit , because these information processing structures weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process using these special information structures because evolution could now take place inside an individual .
it could take place within a time of learning .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , the most refining version of this communication is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , messy and confused idea in my head here .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically adding gruesome sounds of mine hoping to create a similar kind of confusing idea in your head that has a certain similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , we convert it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we create something very complicated about it in others &apos; heads .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we go through the same stages that multi-cell organisms have gone through -- process the abstraction of our methods to capture data , present it .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
telephony , computers , video shelters , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we have been .
so today evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
you also saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he showed a little bit of evolution in the convolution program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve shifted the time scale again .
the first steps in history that i told you was going to last a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , lasted a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so forth , were less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process feeds itself , and so i think car catalytic is the word for it -- if something increases its change speed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosive curve .
we see the process that feeds itself .
i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i can use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology .
my recent work is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design them in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the bonding machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what designers of thinking machines do is we think at a certain level of abstraction , we give this machine over , and the machine does something that exceeds our ability far better and faster than we could ever do .
and she &apos;s doing it in part with methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot lately is evolution itself .
and we install an evolutionary process in the machine that runs off in the microsecond area .
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please generate a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now , please execute all of these random instructions , execute all the programs , and finally select the ones that my presentation is the closest . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , that would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve used for .
so find programs that can rank most numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen instructions is very small that , by accident , you &apos;re not going to sort numbers , so i guess none of the instructions are actually going to do this .
but one of them might be lucky to put two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve done the next thing .
put those off , delete the rest .
now all of the rest of the reproducers that have best sorted the numbers .
it &apos;s a way of recombining , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they make children through the exchange of their subroutines , and the children inherit the features of the subroutines from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that have come out of combinations of programs that have come a little bit closer to what we &apos;ve done than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
reevaluate it .
lead perhaps some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can perfectly sort numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they &apos;re armed and weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you do the job because you come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on whether they got the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , reaching a map and saying , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there it says , &quot; this plane is made up of hundreds of thousands of little pieces that work together to make your flight safer . &apos; does that not make you any more visible ? &quot;
we know that development process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so let &apos;s start to rely on computers for a process that &apos;s very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to do things with much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of that yet .
so , in a sense , technology overwhelps us .
we now use these programs to make the computers much faster so that we can do these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today feed themselves .
we pick up .
we got to a point where the analog is at the time , as one cell organisms have evolved into multi-cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the lights , and we can &apos;t quite make up what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
but i really believe that something more comes after us .
i find it very tiring to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , lunch stands before and i think i &apos;m going to stop here now before i get chosen .
my story starts right here in rajasthan about two years ago .
i was underneath the star sky in the desert with sufi singers of mukhtiar ali .
we talked about nothing changed since the time of the ancient indian epos &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians back then , we jumped into a car and swirl across the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at that time , when the great indian prince of arjuna had thirst , he took a bow , he took it out into the ground and water .
now we do this with drills and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got some fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without camera and without tweet to my friends .
i thought technology should make possible and not kill magic .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver watch .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world of pirates and miserable ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was when our fancy clocks and cameras were dreaming about it .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing it .
when i was 16 , i started illustrating books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that readers can connect all over the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling always needed more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name there .
and i become a character in the book .
every once in a while a letter falls down for me -- and the ipad knows where i live -- it &apos;s really addressed to me .
the child in me is really excited by those possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean not magician and kites , but i mean the magic of childhood , the ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass always found me very exciting .
so here you have to tip out the ipad and let out the fireflies .
and they illuminated the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that an entire galaxy can be in a single murmur .
and so every book here and every world becomes a little murmur that i &apos;m taking here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens a map .
fantasybooks have always had maps , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and lighting and serving for orientation in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be in other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian but also very timely .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of fees and nymps , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras had caught chambers in indras for thousands of years in an old , courageous book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children .
a story associated with new issues like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without going out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction in the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , and you have to go out and collect natural objects with the ipads &apos; camera .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , stones , pebbles and clams .
somehow , children don &apos;t do it anymore .
this childhood ritual is brought back . you have to go out and take a picture of a flower in a chapter .
in another chapter , you have to photograph and tag a piece of construction mri .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fudge and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you &apos;ve actually taken .
there are a variety of ways that magic to connect the world and technology together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads and seeing through augmented reality an animation of elevated appearing on a plant in front of the house .
in one place , the screen fills with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , read it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move towards a world where technology &apos;s natural forces can get closer and can approach in magic and technology .
we use the sun &apos;s energy .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with socially weakest in social settlements and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
being here at ted , watching and hearing how stimulating that is , has given me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things here that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when something comes to ted , it gets a sense and force that it wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a carefully doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i got big in a family , a traditional african-american household dominated by a matriarch , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a tough woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family argument .
she was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was a slave family &apos;s daughter .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as slaves .
she was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her world very strongly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
she pushed me so hard to breathe , then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and when i said no , she hugged me again . when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she left me alone .
she was something that was doing that you always wanted to be close to her .
the only problem with this was she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine that one morning i woke up and went to the living room . all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room , staring at me .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this went on for 15 or 20 minutes . and then she got up and came over to me . she took me by hand and she said , &quot; come on , bryan . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
she took me outside and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promise , oma . &quot;
she said , &quot; honesty ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i watched you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , oma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;ll let you love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re going to take care of her all the time . &quot;
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , i &apos;ll miss myself that you &apos;ll always do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on land in the old , rural south , and i have a brother that &apos;s older a year and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , my brother came home one day and brought this sixth pack beer with my sister and me and went to the forest with us .
we were just albering around the way we used to .
then he took a beat of beer and offered my sister one , and she assumed , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . just do you . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . today we do that , you do all else we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother stared at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now drink something . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to make you crazy about the conversation with oma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; oma tells all the grandchildren they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this may be broadcast publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i say that because identity means identity .
if we can create the right type of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
of course , my grandmother would say all her grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
my uncle died of alcohol induced diseases .
and she believed that these were the issues that we had to care about .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in harbor and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
seven million people have been discharged or dismissed with conditions .
in my opinion , mass incarceration has fundamentally changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , there is despair and hopelessness due to these changes .
one out of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , discharged , or conditional punishment .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , discharged or conditional crimination .
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with racity , it &apos;s also disposed by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that they treat much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
yet we seem quite pleased with this .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some really interesting developments .
my home state of alabama continually deprives them when they &apos;re sentencing them .
here today in alabama , 34 percent of male black people have constantly lost their vote right .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of civil liberation is going to be as high as before the departing of the election law .
silence is anesthetizing .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that convicts three-ten-year-old children to die in prison .
in this country , we have life penalty punishment for children without conditional punishment .
we already have a lot of procedures .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in death cells .
the death penalty issue is an interesting question .
we think because we &apos;ve been taught that the real question is : has a human being earned to die for one of them ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about it depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did anybody deserve for a crime , but : did we deserve to kill it ?
i think this is fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
there &apos;s one that we executed to nine people that we found for innocent , that was unlaid out of death row .
an amazing error rate . one in nine innocent .
i think this is fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly on an airplane if for nine planes to pick up one off .
but somehow we can get ourselves off this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students african-american history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time at the end of reconstruction , all the way to the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the african-american people in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
these older people are now coming to me and saying , &quot; mr , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re giving talks . you tell people to stop saying that for the first time in our nation &apos;s history , we have to do with terrorism after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the rasse rendering and decades of the racist motivated submission and apartheid came .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in historical context .
we are constantly bumping each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the race is not over without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after rwanda genocide , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear them speak like this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , in germany , they can &apos;t be there anymore . &quot;
it got very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever speak back to the systematic killing of people .
it would be inconscience from us to consciously and targeted people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how would it feel to live in a world where german state put people in , especially if there were many jews under the ratio ?
it would be unbearable .
it would be inconscience .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the ancient south , we put people in -- here &apos;s the risk of being judged to death , 11 times higher if the victim is white , 22 times higher when the discharged black and the same victim is in the same state , white .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually these realities are transferred by suffering , abuse , heritage , boundary .
it seems important to me to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about the fact that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to being able to insist in a complex world .
for me , it means time to stop thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged ones that will never be at ted .
but think in a way that &apos;s embedded in our own lives .
we all have to eventually believe things we can &apos;t see .
we do . as rational as we are , we estimate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by persuasion in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head-heart connection that i believe is driving us to be open to all the bright and exciting things , but also the dark and problem .
vaclav havel , the great czech politician , once said .
when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to be all sorts of things , but what we most needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and witness .
this mental orientation is the core of what i think the ted communities have to engage in .
there &apos;s no limitation for technology and design that allows us to be fully human , unless we have eyes and ears for poverty , boundary and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
as a young lawyer , i was privileged to meet rosa parks .
woman parks kept coming back to montgomerery , where she met two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnever carr , who had organized the montgomery bus boykott -- an incredible african-american woman -- and virginia , a , who had a clifford , who had a cliff .
so these women got together and they just talked .
occasionally , woman carr called me and said , &quot; bryan , woman parks comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened .
it was always so inspiring , so flying .
one day i sat there listening to these women , and after a few hours , woman parks turned to me and said , &quot; now bryan , tell me what the equals initiative is right .
what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
wr wants to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to degrade life penalty without conditional punishment for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to lower the number of inmates .
we want to eliminate mass incarceration . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and she said , &quot; yum . gosh . mmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; this will make you very , very tired . &quot;
then woman carr leaned up to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be taper .
we need to be able to find these challenges : these problems , these suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
when someone lies , they &apos;re not just a liar .
when someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , it &apos;s not just a thief .
even if you kill someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and so inspiring , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not the things we &apos;re developing , not on our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but by how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the incarcerated .
because in this context , we &apos;re just beginning to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
sometimes i lose balance . i end up with a story .
sometimes i push too much .
i get tired , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas promote our thinking in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard sentences .
i go to the research prison and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old to stand in court as an adult .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn a judge into something he &apos;s not ?
the judge thinks of him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , oh my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
you should want some .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think anymore , i started working on a contract .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a client .
and i started with this contract . the headline was , &quot; assignment , my arms , 14-year-old black clients like a privileged white , 75-year-old top managers . &quot;
in my contract , i explained that being a misconduct of the prosecution and the police and driver-proof error .
there was a crazy line about the fact that there &apos;s nothing wrong in this country .
the next morning i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i had just dreamed or actually written this crazy assignment .
and to my deputy , i had not only written him , but sent him to court .
a few months went by , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and do this crazy case .
i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought it &apos;s getting so hard , so painful .
finally , i got out of my car and walked up the staircase to the court .
when i was up the staircase , there was an elderly black man , the janitor in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and he hugged me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power to me .
it touched something deeply within me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked into the courthouse .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put this crazy assignment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more and more people came in simply because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and proxy heads of state and office workers .
the courthouse was full of people who were angry that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my point of view , i saw the janitor go up and down .
he kept seeing through the window and could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went up and down .
after all , this older black man came in with a very concerned facial excitement in the court , and sat right behind me almost on the defense bank .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
and at the break , a police officer came in that troubled the janitor was in the courthouse .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the courthouse ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to say to this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up on time . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far wiping out , but it &apos;s increasing justice .
we &apos;re not completely designed as humans unless we care about human rights and basic values .
that our survival is linked to each individual survival .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen an obvious wish in this audience , this community , and you &apos;ve heard to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
when they live in california , there &apos;s a volcanic decision in this spring that &apos;s actually about trying to do something about the money that otherwise flows into the politics of punishment .
for example , here in california , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all deadliances don &apos;t end with an arrement .
56 percent of rape cases do not come to court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
this reference will suggest that investing money in more security bugs and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america has declined immense .
this fact is often put into a context with the increased incarceration numbers .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes has not changed very much .
most of the mass incarceration in this country was not really in the class of violent crime .
it was the misguided crossroads against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come to prison inmates .
we teamed ourselves off the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; three violations &quot; laws that get people behind bars forever for a bicycle theft , for the theft of low good , instead of forcing them to return the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a criminal , not less .
and i don &apos;t think our current punishment philosophy can help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , they really brought a string to the swings here .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
bin laden &apos;s death takes an increased risk of risk of risk .
speaker 2 : famine in somalia . speaker 3 : pepper spray of police .
four : malignant cartels . speaker five : dangerous crossroads .
six : social waste . speaker 7 : 65 deaths .
eight : tsunami . speaker 9 : cyberattacks
different speakers : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tornado .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days . or the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are paying attention to these very issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second , every day , our senses catch much more information than our brains can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first place for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our vehicle detector .
it carries and dives all the information on the search for any kind of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage &quot; when it bleeds , the demand &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days a week to make all these negative news 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks the world is getting worse and worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe in the last century , the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve accelerated through a series of forces is so strong that in the next three decades we can create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , species , water and energy problems -- we already have them .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at anticipating problems in a very long way , but ultimately overcoming them .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has been doubling more than doubling in inflation has tripled to the average income in the world .
child mortality has dropped by a tenth of a second .
the point is that the food , electricity , transportation and communication costs have decreased by a variety of times .
steve pinker has shown us that we are living in a very peaceful time of human history right now .
and according to charles kenny , the literacy rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent over the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we keep increasing our expectations .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
remember that a lot of americans living under the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , climate plants and cars .
the richest capitalists in the last century , the imperators on earth , could never have dreamed of such luxury goods .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and these grow expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes an information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law doubled the price performance quotient every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less , and is a thousandfold faster than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smoothly she lost -- in good times like bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high juncture .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down for any of our big problems .
and also , despite their logarithmic course on the left , it &apos;s going up .
so growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies all available .
cloud-computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinit computing , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow you to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm superwatson at risk ?
that was great .
i went through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one : &quot; watson is constraining human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every mobile phone owner .
four years ago , ray kurzweil started , and i started a new university here at ted called singularity university .
we teach our students all of these technologies with special focus on how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask the students to create products and services that can contain the lives of billions of people in a decade .
think about a group of students today being able to influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have sounds ridiculous .
today , we can point to dozens of companies who have done this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about me creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making excess out of scarce goods .
in fact , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a liberating force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleon &apos;s soldiers got silver bribe , napoleon himself got gold brick .
but the king of siam got aluminum brick .
aluminum , at that time , was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome of the washington monument was made for aluminum .
although aluminum takes 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it does not appear to be pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon .
but then the technology of electrolysis was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our disposal mentality .
then let &apos;s project this analogy once into the future .
we think of energy shortage today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet full of 5,000-times more energy than we use every year .
16 terawatts of energy prashes every 88 minutes to the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not scarcity ; the problem is accessibility .
and there &apos;s good news .
that year , the first time you &apos;ve ever managed to reduce the cost of solar power in india is 50 percent of the same power -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
solar used to drop 50 percent last year .
this has been published last month with a study showing that up to the end of this decade in sunny areas of solar power per cent kwh , compared to 15 cents on national average .
and if we have an overload of energy , we will also have water overflow .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember when carl sagan turned back to earth the voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when saturn was moving by to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent covered in water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent saltwater , two percent is gone , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologies along the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the do it yourself , i want to share with you guys -- he gave me permission -- his technolgy , which is called &quot; slingshot , &quot; which many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a cold student .
it can generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- all of that for less than two cents a liter .
the head of coca-cola has just agreed to launch a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if it all goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology supported innovation that we have today .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we &apos;ll soon reach the 70 percent reduction rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a massai warrior in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you &apos;re looking for google with your smartphone , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication abundance , as nobody could have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnose -- are now literally dematerialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part is possibly what we expect in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of announcing the qualo foundation what we call $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder x prize .
we challenge teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test purists or your blood values .
and to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequences a retirement virus or a dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health agency and prevents a pandemic from its outbreak .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are the population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
and just by the way , the biggest insurance against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition all over the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re moving from two to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard of before will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of economic standstill , i see one of the greatest economic issues in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to get healthier by using the tricoder , and they &apos;re going to be better trained by the khan academy , and by having the possibility of using 3d printer and infinite computing , and being much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
how about a set of new , never heard people vote before .
how about giving the oppressed wherever you are , a voice to focus on and to create change for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things that could create big businesses and governments only in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with some of you .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far this has been a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that nowadays human pattern recognition better fold the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who is the best protein folder in the world , this was not a mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was a assistant to the business guidance in a rehab and the health clinic at night .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to face the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to exponential technology tools .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
we have the capital of tech philanthropes .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to address the new challenges , and to do what it takes .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a changing piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time , as if i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own false premise to allow this to happen .
but before i get to the point of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the seasonal , and we &apos;re moving to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
moneyball appears soon and turns to statistics and to make use of a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we &apos;re talking about 300 when a bat hits 300 .
what that means is that the player will definitely beat three out of 10 beats .
that means knocking the ball into the field , it comes up , it &apos;s not caught , and if you tried to throw the ball at first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time , and the runner was safe .
three from 10 .
do you know what they call a 3,000 in major league baseball ?
all right , really good , maybe a single star .
do you know what they call a 400th ?
this is someone who , by the way , meets four out of 10 .
legendary -- like ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player who met during a regular season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable after i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a blind dart , and you will transfer to an operator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blindness .
it doesn &apos;t work somehow , doesn &apos;t it ?
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved person with clogged heart disease , and your veterinarian shows this to a cardiologist whose average performance for vascular representation is 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the rising line .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
it doesn &apos;t work in some way .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday worker , should be a rescue assistant ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a rescue .
what we do , however , is that we include each of you , to send me into the world with the claim of perfect .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s worried about the details of how to do that .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was an obsessively obsessive student .
in high school , one of the students once said that brian goldman would learn a bleeding test .
and so was it .
and i learned in my little dachstep at the nurses residence at the toronto general hospital , not far from here .
i learned everything memorized .
in my anatomic lecture , i learned the origins and exchanges of every muscle , every branch that takes away from the aorta , obscure and ordinary differential diagnoses .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renal tubuchre azican .
and all the time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i graduated from cum laude .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything memorized and knew everything , or at least as close as possible , i was able to immun against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while until i met woman printer .
i resisted at a teaching hospital here in toronto as a woman printer to me in the emergency room .
at that point i was dedicated to the cardiology layer in the cardiology service .
and it was my mission when the emergency staff was looking for cardiological advice to study the emergency patient .
giving feedback to my superdoctor .
i studied woman drucker , and she was in respiratory distress .
and when i listened to her , she made cookie sounds .
and when i finished her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a cracking sound on both sides that told me she suffered under congestive heart failure .
this is a state where the heart fails , instead of pumping all the blood further , a part of the blood is stuck in the lung and filling it gradually , so the shorthand came .
and that was not hard to diagnose .
i put them on and i went to treatment .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the diuretics , tobacco water , so they goodbye to the fluid .
and over a period of a year and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to my doctor .
i didn &apos;t take up the audience , and i did what i should have , which would have been a call to my supreme doctor , so he would have an opportunity to take on his own image .
and he knew her , he would have been able to contribute additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so negotiated and so i would be able to care for my patients without having to contact them .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent her home , i made a lousy voice in me trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i was so lacked by self-confidence that i asked the nurse to take care of women , &quot; do you think that &apos;s okay when she comes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , in fact , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i signed the discharge papers and a hospital and rescue assistant came home and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , i left the hospital and went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when i did something i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went home through the emergency department .
and there , another nurse said , not the nurse who had seen after woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most emergency doctors i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the emergency medicine is special because we only see the patients so fleeting .
the three words were : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
the nurse actually asked .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular pitch .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about an hour after she arrived at home after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 . rescue assistants took her back to the emergency ward with a 50-odd blood pressure , which is a dangerous shock state .
she hardly breathed and ran blue .
the emergency staff did all the strands .
they gave her blood pressure up .
they added it to the machine .
i was shocked and tortured to the inside .
and i lived through that rollercoaster because she came to the intensive care station after the stability , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , she realized she would never wake up again .
it had suffered a non-treatable brain damage .
her family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they came up with this .
the other day they listed them -- woman printer , woman , mother and grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks , i was making a blueprint , and i learned for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you can feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s best friend , even though it gives you the faithful and then you get caught and the best friend confronts you and leads you a terrible discussion when you end up with the bad conscience and you never make such a mistake .
if you do goodwill and never make the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of educational shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but that you &apos;re bad at yourself .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my homarch , he was very dear .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s cleaning the wounds and making sure i was not going to be sued .
but i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly but it figured out .
i started feeling better .
and then on a cloudy day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i said maybe i can feel better again .
and i negotiated with myself that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again committed a mistake that the voice could be confused .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i was in the emergency ward in a community hospital north of toronto , and i was reviewing a 25 year-old man with a mature rake .
it was a lot off , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the cracks , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he walked out of the door , he pointed at his rake .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my editor asked me to interview her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember that ?
&quot; do you remember the patients who went to the rake ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a streptococcus infection .
he had a potentially dangerous life-dangerous disease called epiglottitis .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection of the rachens , but the top respiratory pathways , and it &apos;s causing respiratory pathways .
and fortunately , he did not die .
he got intravenous antibotica and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , feeling liberated , and went to work until it happened again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve overlooked a blindfold twice .
there &apos;s a lot of that already , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital at that time only had 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no man in their treatment .
one of them i thought he had kidney stones .
i ordered the kidney x-ray , and when that was no finding , my colleague put a hardening in the lower right sector , and called the operator .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i ordered fluide to rehyder it and asked my colleagues to review it as well .
and he did , and when he found a hardening in the lower right sector , he called the operators .
they were doing surgery in both cases , and they were fine .
both cases grabbed me , ask me questions .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim , but is total nonsense .
some of my lbs have happened over the last five years .
alone , damaged and damaged without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t finish up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i voice the quiet that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so they don &apos;t make the same mistakes ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when was the last time you heard about someone who was talking about failure ?
oh yeah , they &apos;re going to a cocktail party , and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if i were to go into a room full of colleagues and ask them their immediate support , and find out what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t be very likely to reach the end of the second story before they were really uncomfortable , anybody would intervene with a joke , they would change the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that an orthopedic in my hospital had taken off the wrong leg , believe me i had trouble looking at him .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and the ones who don &apos;t make them -- the ones that restrict the sleeping shortage and the without restriction that with bad results and good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies attacking a human being .
and there &apos;s an idea that if we associate those who make mistakes from medicine , we &apos;re going to stay safe .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medical awareness and journalism , i did a personal medical study on medical errors and false treatments to learn everything i could for a first article i did for toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black way to learn . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inexhaustible .
we work in a system where every day we make mistakes , where one in 10 medications is either false or wrong , where hospital infections always get more and more numerous and devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of a common error .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is 100,000 .
both are strong subfutions , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as exactly as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two to three years , we cannot keep up .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect pathology course for a patient with breast pain .
then i take the same patient with breast pain , swimming it and irritating and giving it a slightly alcoholistic breath , and all of a sudden the story is transmitted with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things the same .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are inevitable .
so if you take the system in the way that i was taught and you sorted out all the steady health professionals , there is no one left at the end .
and do you know the ladders about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would show to everyone from rescue to the cardiologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah ?
and then their pupils expand , they &apos;ve pushed in front of their head , then they look down and they look hard , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
what they need is an environment that makes them capable of doing that .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the redefined doctor is a human , white man , accepted her humanity , is not proud of making mistakes , but sets everything out of them so that it can be passed on .
it divides its experiences with others .
it supports them when others talk about their mistakes .
and it indicates other errors , not to mere , but in a loving , supportive way that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that is , people make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system develops to create backups that make it easier to find errors that make people inevitable and make it equally enabling supportive spaces in which anyone watching the health care can actually address things that should be potentially rewarded and even the reward for me and even the same errors .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m unfortunate , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to pass on to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about changing standards .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories earlier to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was here in 1835 .
you might think he chased fins , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually gathered fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; ordinary . &quot;
it was a grouper .
until the &apos; 80s , he was fished in a big way .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of endangered species .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we &apos;re still in the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re primal .
the brochures still describe them as untouched .
what happened here ?
the second story is to illustrate another concept that is changing tails .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sunburn , and i was convinced that i really did not come from there .
it was my first sunburn .
as you can see , the lagoon of palms was surrounded by a few mangroves .
there were federal barrels of about 20 centimeters , black-and-mouth brothers , a federal barrels .
the fisheries of these buntbarrels were very productive , and the fishermen lived well off and earned goods in ghana above average .
when i came back 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
they grow five centimeters .
they had been genetically pressed .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is telling me about my participation in introducing the trawl fishery in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the early &apos; 60s , europe promoted many development projects .
fisheries that have already caught 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this fairly ugly ship is called mutiara 44 .
i went to mit , and we made elevations all over the southern south china sea and especially in javasee .
we had no words for what we started there .
now i know it was the cause of the sea .
ninety percent of our early days were sponges , other animals associated with the reason .
most of the fish , the little dots there on the rubber , the stamp , were coral reef fish .
basically , the bottom of the sea came on deck and then was thrown back .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is going very fast .
within a year , you run an elevation and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is going to change . for -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is getting more matchy .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
we started a vivid one .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
then they wanted to kill her , because you could eat her well .
in fact , this mountain of trucks are accumulated by fishermen every time they drive into areas where they &apos;ve never been fished .
it &apos;s not being documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our standards to the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves what was there .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis there are some good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are very natural .
every generation is looking at the images they take at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will deflect everything .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous losses .
there can be a series of changes .
and in the end , they just want to get the sufficient remains .
that &apos;s exactly our goal right now .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer the way they have been .
now you could think that the problem of people who were certainly living in predator societies was killing animals and who only realized what they had done after a few generations .
because obviously , an animal that was very common becomes rarely before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose often occurring animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a huge loss .
over time , we &apos;re focusing on the large animals and in the ocean , these are the big fish .
they get less rare because we catch them .
there &apos;s little fish left over over time , and we think that &apos;s the standards .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
well , because they don &apos;t know it was even different .
of course , many people , scientists , will tell that it was really different .
they will confirm it , because the evidence of how they prefer in an earlier form is not the way they would like to demonstrate the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a captain soundso that observed big fishing offspring in this area , cannot be used or can &apos;t be used by fishermen normally because they &apos;re not scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous role that a marine reserve can play .
because through marine reserves , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
we &apos;re restoring the past that people can &apos;t understand because standards have changed and are very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve can benefit from the insight that enables them to reset their standards .
what about the people that are not possible because they have no access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think art and film may fill the gap and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and the attitudes may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except by the pocahoney story , why were they so touched by the image world ?
because it calls something that has sort of been lost .
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is to cameron so that he turns &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist eastern germany , if you had a typewriter , you had to register it in the government .
they also had to register a sheet of unprecedented text from this typewriter .
the reason : the government could track back where a text came from .
they found an article with false thought , they could detect the creator of that thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do this in the west , and how much that would restrict freedom of speech .
in our own countries we would never do that .
but if you buy a new color printer today in 2011 from the leading laser prints and print out a page , this side bright yellow blob on every side in a pattern that clearly leaves the page on you and tracks your printer .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to us today .
and nobody seems to rain up above that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems we have today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks into categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from jaw in ukraine .
and online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online millionaides , multimillionaides that made their money through attacks .
this is wladime tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
bjlocal sundin .
these are matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so forth .
these people have come online too rich , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by applying our credit card information to claim money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keyloggers that have collected our credit card information on the computer while we &apos;ve got the keyboard .
the u.s. intelligence agency fror , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and in this conto , was 14.9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on a free foot , the repository is unknown .
and what i &apos;m saying today is that we &apos;re more likely to be victims of an online fragile than a real world crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only getting worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
the second largest attacker group we see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , for example , an opinion , or by your audience .
groups like anonymous have gone up over the last 12 months and have become one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main group of attack : criminals who do it for money are hacklists like anonymous who are resistant to it , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attacks .
we have cases like diginotar .
it &apos;s an example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a complete certificate from the netherlands -- or it was .
last fall , it had to sign up insolves because diginotar was hacked .
somebody had collapsed and hacked the system in a thoroughly .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government officials , i asked one of the senior government officials of this group to see if he was able to hide that because of the buried hacks , people had died .
and his answer was yes .
now , how do people die in the aftermath of such a hack ?
diginotar is a certification place .
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
now , a certificate requires if you have a website with https , with ssl-encrypted services , for example , gmail .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially distributed in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign vendors like gmail , because they know that they can &apos;t trust more than local government providers and so on their own .
but can you do that if you &apos;re in a foreign space ?
authorities hack and fake certificate .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the trap of diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
well , in egypt plunders , the insurgency in april of 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian secret police , and they found a lot of records .
in these records there was a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder they were notes from a company in germany that the egyptian government had sold a few programs with , in very large framework , could capture all the communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
corporate headquarters are right here .
so western governments provide totalitarian governments with aid so that they can do it against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , just a few weeks ago in germany , the so-called state strajans found , which was a trojan that was used by german government officials to occupy their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspected in a criminal case , your phone will be taped with pretty security .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use tools like the state strajan to interpere with a trojan computer that allows them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online discussions , collect their passwords .
so if we continue to think about these things , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while today , in 2011 , our governments may trust us , every right we &apos;re going to lose forever .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust any future government , a government we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with over the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
the first concrete stones were made in 1868 and developed a simple idea : module from cement with solid measurements that fit together .
concrete bricks became very quickly the most used unit of construction in the world .
they enabled us to build things bigger than us , buildings , bridges , one stone at a time .
essentially the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was automatically called the &quot; compiling rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego essentially took the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the same year at bell labs , bell labs was announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , stacked building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex cycles , one stone at a time .
but there &apos;s a key difference : the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re preferred to be light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
they can &apos;t get them wrong .
the stones are colored coded .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly larger circles .
they put a blue one on a green one , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and you &apos;ve created a little dimmer .
take the switch out to add a pulsmodule that &apos;s here , and they made a little blind .
add this buzzer to an extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple games , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to program , wired or delete , littlebits allows them to program with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the blind or slow down , just turn on that button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind littlebit is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a common-made rock .
lights , notes , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve distributed littlebits to children , and you see playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you don &apos;t learn in school ?
for example , how a night light works , or why the doors of the elevator react , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also brought littlebits to design schools .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience whatsoever in electronic things that started playing with littviits as a material .
here we see , with film , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought littlebits to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just karton and wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a movable , ticker cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a play-doh hummer who &apos;s scared of darkness .
for those non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so littalive is open source .
you can go to the website , download all the design facilities and make them yourself .
we want the world of creators , inventors , who are encouraging contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , go ahead and start inventing .
thank you .
